//! §23.8 / §26.3 — names inside an interface task resolve in the
//! interface's LEXICAL scope, never in the scope of whoever called the task
//! through a virtual interface. The reference simulator prints
//! `WHO=package`: the unqualified `who()` binds to the package function
//! imported into the interface, not to the calling class's method.
//!
//! This is the shape behind UVM's `uvm_info` inside a BFM task called from a
//! driver proxy: the macro's unqualified report calls must reach the global
//! reporter. xezim resolves them dynamically today (`WHO=class`), so such
//! messages are attributed to the calling component.
