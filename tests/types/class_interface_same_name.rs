// Self-test: IEEE 1800-2017 §3.12/§3.13 — a CLASS and an INTERFACE may
// legally share a name. A plain (non-`virtual`) block-local declaration
// `shared h;` is a CLASS HANDLE, not a virtual interface, even though the
// name also denotes an interface.
//
// Before the fix, the runtime's virtual-interface detector
// (`is_virtual_iface_type`) classified ANY `TypeReference` whose name was
// also an interface as a virtual interface — it never checked whether the
// name was ALSO a class. With `interface shared;` + `class shared;`, a
// procedural `shared h; h = new(5);` was therefore intercepted as a virtual
// interface BINDING rather than a class construction: the `new(5)` ran as a
// generic call and stored a null handle. Reading `h.x` then faulted with a
// null-object dereference, whereas the same collision with a *module*
// (`class shared` + `module shared`) worked correctly.
//
// The fix makes `is_virtual_iface_type` prefer the CLASS when a plain
// `TypeReference` name is BOTH an interface and a class — only an explicit
// `virtual <iface>` unambiguously denotes a virtual interface.
