//! §10.9.2: a NAMED assignment pattern in a CONTINUOUS whole-struct assign.
//!
//! The PROCEDURAL form already worked and is covered by
//! `struct_named_patterns.rs` (`s = '{x: 5, y: 8'h22};` inside an
//! initial block). This is the continuous form, which takes a different
//! path -- `expand_whole_struct_continuous_assigns` -> 
//! `emit_struct_member_assigns` -- and did not handle named items at all.
//!
//! An unpacked struct is stored one signal per member, so
//! `assign s = <pattern>` is expanded member-wise. That expansion took the
//! pattern apart only when every item was ORDERED:
//!
//!     assign s = '{3.0e-3, 1.8086};        // positional -- worked
//!     assign s = '{i: 3.0e-3, v: 1.8086};  // named      -- wrote ZEROS
//!
//! The map returned None for a named item and `collect::<Option<Vec<_>>>`
//! short-circuits the whole pattern on the first one, so the fallback ran:
//! member-selecting the literal, `'{i: ..., v: ...}.i`, which the expansion's
//! own comment already identifies as having no evaluation path and yielding
//! 0. The guard was written for that hazard and then reached from the other
//! side.
//!
//! Silent, and the failure is a struct of zeros -- not an error, not an X.
//! §10.9.2 gives both forms equal standing, and named is what anyone writes
//! for a struct whose member order is not self-evident.
//!
//! These assert VALUES. A test that only checked "the assign happened" would
//! have passed against the bug: it did happen, onto members that stayed zero.
