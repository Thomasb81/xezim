//! §6.6.7 + §10.3: a user-defined nettype net driven from a struct VARIABLE.
//!
//! A nettype whose data type is an unpacked struct is stored as one signal
//! per member, so a whole-struct value has to be expanded member-wise. The
//! WRITE side did that already. The driver side did not: drivers were packed
//! into the resolution-function call as written.
//!
//! A driver that is already an assignment pattern survives, because it is
//! member-wise as authored:
//!
//!     assign n = '{i: 3.0e-3, v: 0.0};        // resolved correctly
//!
//! A driver naming a struct variable has no whole-struct value to read, so
//! the resolver received uninitialised members -- nan, or zero once a later
//! pass defaulted them:
//!
//!     nd_t t;  always_comb t = ...;
//!     assign n = t;                           // members arrived empty
//!
//! Both are legal. §10.3 gives `net_assignment ::= net_lvalue = expression`
//! and an expression may name a variable; the only restriction the clause
//! puts on a user-defined nettype is on the LEFT-hand side ("shall not
//! contain any indexing or select"). So the driver is expanded member-wise,
//! not rejected.
//!
//! WHY IT MATTERS beyond the clause. A SPICE node is bidirectional: current
//! is injected into it and a voltage is present on it, both properties of
//! one net. Carrying that needs an aggregate nettype -- IEEE 1800-2017
//! 6.6.7(d), and the LRM's own example in that clause is exactly a
//! `{real; bit;}` struct. Without it, a real-number model must split every
//! analog node into two ports, and cannot be instantiated against the
//! netlist's own hierarchy.
//!
//! The values are asserted, not just the fact that resolution ran. The
//! failing mode produced a resolver that WAS called, with the right driver
//! count, and members that were quietly empty -- a test that checked only
//! "did it resolve" would have passed against the bug.
