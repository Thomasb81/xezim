//! Flop skip (event-edge, write-armed) for blocks that read or write an
//! unpacked array through a DYNAMIC index. Such blocks used to be permanently
//! non-gateable; now every element of the array is an arm-only input, so a
//! skip is only possible while no element (and no scalar input) was written.
//! Each case below would print a stale value if an element write failed to
//! re-arm the block.
