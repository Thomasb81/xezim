//! A fork child that outlives its creating method must not leak its *stale*
//! automatic-locals into the unrelated activation that later reuses the same
//! caller-frame slot.
//!
//! §6.21/§9.3.2: automatic variables of a method are per-activation. xezim
//! models these as call-frame slots, so two different task definitions with
//! the same local name (here `count`) occupy the *same* slot index when the
//! tasks are called from one caller. A `fork ... join_any` child (the `forever`
//! reader below) is still alive after its creating method returns; per the
//! standard its `count` — a copy of the *first* activation's automatic — is
//! dead, and its later writes must NOT land in the second activation's
//! `count` slot.
//!
//! Pre-fix, the orphaned reader from `alpha` kept merging its stale `count`
//! into the parent's current frame, which by then held `beta`'s `count`, so
//! `beta` finished with a corrupted count (alpha's orphan increments added
//! on top of beta's real ones). The fix tags each frame slot with a generation
//! and only lets a child merge into a slot that still belongs to the activation
//! it forked from (see `merge_fork_writes`).
