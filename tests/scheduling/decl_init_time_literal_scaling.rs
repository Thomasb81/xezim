//! §5.8: "The time literal is interpreted as a realtime value scaled to the
//! current time unit and rounded to the current time precision." There is no
//! exemption for constant expressions, and §6.20.2 does not carve one out for
//! parameter declarations.
//!
//! The scope-time pass applied that scaling to STATEMENTS only, so procedural
//! code was correct — `#100ns`, `x = 100ns`, an automatic-variable initialiser
//! — while a DECLARATION initialiser kept its `NumberLiteral::Time` and fell
//! through to the fixed-1ns fallback in expression evaluation (`secs * 1e9`).
//! It was therefore scaled to nanoseconds no matter what the module declared:
//!
//! ```text
//!                                 `timescale 1fs/1fs, both meaning 100 ns
//!   #100ns                                   100000000   correct
//!   localparam realtime T = 100ns                  100   1e6 short
//! ```
//!
//! Two things kept this quiet. The error is the ratio `1ns / timeunit`, so a
//! module at the default 1 ns unit was ACCIDENTALLY correct — the bug only
//! appeared once someone chose a fine timescale on purpose. And `100ns / 1ns`
//! is `100`, the same number a "drop the suffix" bug would produce, so the
//! obvious test case cannot tell the two mechanisms apart. `300ps` and `1us`
//! can, and both are pinned below.
//!
//! Worse than a scale factor: a sub-nanosecond literal did not shrink, it
//! VANISHED. Under `1ps/1ps` a `localparam realtime D = 300ps` folded to 0.3,
//! which rounds to zero at the module's precision — a reset-path delay in a
//! PFD written that way disappeared, giving a zero-width reset rather than an
//! obviously wrong one.
//!
//! Cross-checked against Icarus Verilog 14.0, which produces the "want"
//! column below for every case here.
