//! §6.21 / §13.3 — a fixed-size array declared in a module-scope `automatic`
//! task is per-invocation: every concurrent invocation owns its storage, just
//! like a class-method local (compare `concurrent_method_local_arrays`).
//! Previously only class-method locals got that isolation; an `automatic`
//! task's `int loc[K]` was registered under its bare name, so two sequences
//! running the task concurrently shared one `loc[2]`. Each wrote `loc[0]`
//! before a blocking `#1`, then read it back after the resume — the second
//! invocation saw the first's element and produced the wrong result (the
//! reference simulator printed `1 101 202`; xezim printed `1 202 0`). The
//! expected lines are the reference simulator's output.
