//! §8.9 — a `static` collection (queue / assoc array) is one copy PER CLASS,
//! shared across instances/subclasses but NOT across distinct classes. Two
//! sibling classes declaring a same-named `static … settings[$]` must get
//! separate stores. xezim materialized every static collection under its bare
//! name, so the two siblings shared one cell: a module-scope read of either
//! (`A.settings[k]`, `.size()`) or an in-method bare access collided. In UVM
//! this made the four sibling `uvm_cmdline_*` classes' `settings` queues share
//! storage, so a verbosity `+UVM_VERBOSITY=` setting leaked into the
//! `uvm_set_action=/uvm_set_severity=/uvm_set_verbosity=` checkers, emitting
//! spurious "never took effect" INVLCMDARGS warnings that inflated the warning
//! severity count and broke self-checking report tests. Verified byte-for-byte
//! against a reference simulator.
