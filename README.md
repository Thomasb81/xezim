## What xezim does

xezim reads Verilog and SystemVerilog source files and simulates them. It
preprocesses and parses the sources, elaborates the design hierarchy, compiles
processes and continuous assignments into bytecode, and runs them on an
event-driven kernel that follows the IEEE 1800 scheduling semantics. Most
logic runs on fast two-state executors, which fall back to full four-state
evaluation wherever `x` and `z` values appear.

Everything happens in one invocation, so a design goes from source to results
without a separate build step, and a test suite made of many short runs gets
its answers quickly. The same command line works for an RTL unit test, a
gate-level netlist with SDF timing, or a full UVM environment.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aionhw/xezim.git
cd xezim
cargo build --release          # or ./scripts/build-pgo.sh for a profile-guided build
```

```systemverilog
// counter.sv
module counter_tb;
  logic clk = 0, rst = 1;
  logic [3:0] count;
  always #5 clk = ~clk;
  always_ff @(posedge clk) count <= rst ? '0 : count + 1;
  initial begin
    #12 rst = 0;
    repeat (3) @(posedge clk) $display("t=%0t count=%0d", $time, count);
    $finish;
  end
endmodule
```

```text
$ ./target/release/xezim counter.sv
t=15 count=0
t=25 count=1
t=35 count=2
Simulation finished at time 35 ($finish called)
```

A UVM testbench needs only the UVM sources on the command line:

```bash
xezim -s top -I $UVM/src $UVM/src/uvm_pkg.sv <design and testbench files> \
      +UVM_TESTNAME=my_test
```

See the [user guide](docs/user-guide.md) and the
[UVM guide](docs/uvm-guide.md) for more.

## Performance

Whole-run wall-clock time on one machine (Intel Core i7-9800X, 6 cores,
Linux): xezim 0.11 as a plain release build, against a commercial reference
simulator in its optimized mode (no debug visibility). Both simulators produce
the same results on every row.

| Workload | xezim 0.11 | Reference simulator |
|---|---|---|
| XuanTie C906 SoC, CoreMark ×1 (295,294 cycles) | 91 s | 82 s, 44 s of it simulating |
| XuanTie C910 dual-core SoC, memcpy ×200, cold start | 118 s, about 18 s of it compiling | 136 s, 97 s of it simulating |
| AXI4 AVIP, UVM base test | 5.8 s | 97 s, 51 s of it simulating |

- **xezim starts fast.** Compiling and elaborating is a small part of a run,
  so short tests and suites of many runs favour xezim.
- **On long runs the reference kernel is faster**, about 2× in the
  simulation phase on the C906, and more on long UVM runs. Closing this gap
  is where current work goes: since 0.11, host instructions are down 7% on
  CoreMark and on the AXI4 AVIP and 11% on the C910 memcpy, and peak memory
  on the C906 CoreMark run is down from 2.6 GB to 0.6 GB (see the
  [release notes](NOTES.md)).

To get the most out of a build, use the
[profile-guided build](docs/building.md#profile-guided-build) (up to 14.5%
fewer instructions when trained on your own workload) and keep the
[warm design cache](docs/user-guide.md#warm-design-cache) on.
[Native compilation](docs/user-guide.md#native-compilation) pays on designs
with few, very hot blocks (Ibex CoreMark −23%), so measure it on yours.

## Conformance

- **sv-tests:** xezim 0.11.0 passes 4,722 of 4,770 tests (99.0%) of the
  [sv-tests](https://github.com/chipsalliance/sv-tests) suite.
- **UVM:** the mbits-mirafra AVIP base tests for AXI4, APB, I3C, SPI and
  AXI4-Lite print the same UVM messages as a commercial reference simulator,
  and 32 of 35 UVM 1800.2-2017 example testbenches pass.
- **Regression suite:** more than 3,200 tests, run in CI with and without the
  JIT. Many are differential tests whose expected values were measured on a
  commercial reference simulator; see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#test-suites).

## Support

Questions, bug reports and feature requests go to
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/aionhw/xezim/issues). A small
self-checking testcase gets a bug fixed fastest; see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for what to include. Pull requests are
welcome.

## Background

xezim explores whether modern tools and AI assistance can sharply reduce the
cost of building core EDA infrastructure such as a simulator: work that has
traditionally taken large teams many years. It was built incrementally, from
simple combinational logic up to SoCs and UVM environments, with every step
verified against the language standard and against a commercial reference
simulator. Longer term, the project looks at cloud-scale and distributed
multi-CPU simulation.

The project was previously developed under the name `sisSIM`.
