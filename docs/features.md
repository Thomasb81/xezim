# Supported features

What xezim supports, in more detail than the [README](../README.md). Changes
per release are in the [release notes](../NOTES.md).

## Language

* IEEE 1800-2023 grammar by default; `--sv2017` selects the 1800-2017 edition.
* Event-driven simulation of RTL and gate-level netlists — continuous
  assignments, procedural blocks and the IEEE 1800 scheduling regions, UDPs and
  drive strengths, specify-block delays and timing checks, and SDF
  back-annotation (`--sdf`).
* Classes, constrained randomization, covergroups and concurrent assertions
  (SVA).
* **Event-control `iff` guards** (§9.4.2.3) — `@(posedge clk iff rst_n)` is
  honoured in both procedural `@` waits and edge-sensitive `always` blocks: the
  process resumes only on an edge where the guard holds.
* **Deferred immediate assertions** (§16.4) — `assert #0` / `assert final`
  evaluate where they run, but their action block runs only when the report
  matures at the end of the time slot; a report is dropped if its process
  resumes first, and one still pending at `$finish` prints a note instead of
  running its action.
* **User-defined nettypes with resolution functions** (§6.6.7) —
  `nettype T wire_t with resolver;` including Z-skip and built-in resolution.
* **Per-module timescales** (§3.14, §20.3, §21.3.5) — `$time`/`$realtime`
  scale to the calling module's time unit; `timeunit`/`timeprecision`
  declarations scale delays; `$timeformat`/`%t` and `$printtimescale` are
  honoured; precision down to `fs`. Modules without a source-level timescale
  can be given one from the command line (see the
  [module-timescale extension](user-guide.md#module-timescale-extension)).
* **`bind` by instance path** (§23.11) — `bind top.u_dut.u_sub target_tb u_tb();`
  and the colon form bind only the named instances, with upward references from
  the bound module resolving against the instance they were bound into.
* **Power intent (IEEE 1801 UPF)** via `--upf <file>` and `--upf-top
  <instance>` — supply nets and power switches, powered-down corruption to `x`,
  isolation and retention, with the supplies driven from the testbench through
  the standard `UPF` package. See the [UPF guide](upf-guide.md).

## UVM

* **Accellera 1800.2-2017 and 1800.2-2020.3.1** run end to end: build →
  connect → topology → `run_phase` stimulus → sequencer↔driver TLM handshake
  → packet collection → objection-driven termination → report summary.
  Multiple top modules (`-s hdl_top -s hvl_top`) and virtual-interface
  `config_db` are supported.
* The GettingVerilatorStartedWithUVM reference testbench reaches exact parity
  with Verilator on the 2017 library and runs green on 2020.3.1, and 32 of 35
  UVM 1800.2-2017 example testbenches pass. The mbits-mirafra AVIP base tests
  for AXI4, APB, I3C, SPI and AXI4-Lite print the same UVM messages as a
  commercial reference simulator.
* **UVM's DPI-C library is built in.** Compile UVM without `-DUVM_NO_DPI` and
  its regex matching (config_db / resource_db wildcards and `/regex/` scopes,
  `+uvm_set_*` plusargs, factory overrides by path), command-line processing
  and `uvm_hdl_*` backdoor access (read / deposit / force / release by full
  path, including bit- and part-selects, memory words and packed-struct
  members) run natively, with the C code's semantics and `UVM/DPI/*` error
  reports. A `--dpi-lib` library defining the same symbols takes precedence.
* UVM 1.2 runs too, demonstrated by the `riscv-dv` instruction generator end
  to end (random RV32IMC programs that assemble cleanly with
  `riscv64-unknown-elf-as -march=rv32imc_zicsr_zifencei`).

See the [UVM guide](uvm-guide.md).

## Coverage

* **Functional and assertion coverage**, always on — covergroups (explicit,
  automatic, array, wildcard and transition bins, `ignore_bins`/`illegal_bins`,
  crosses, `iff` guards, `at_least`/`weight`/`auto_bin_max`/`merge_instances`),
  the `get_coverage()`/`get_inst_coverage()`/`$get_coverage()` queries, and
  pass/fail counts for `cover property` and the assertions. A run with any of
  them writes the results to `xezim_cov.json` (`XEZIM_COV_DB=<path>` to move
  it).
* **Code coverage**, off by default — statement, branch and toggle counts with
  `--code-coverage` (or `+cover`), per instance and per design unit, in the
  same `xezim_cov.json`. Instrumented at compile time, so a run without it pays
  nothing.

See the [coverage guide](coverage-guide.md).

## Debug and integration

* **Waveforms** (`--wave`, off by default) — VCD, FST (`--fst`) and XTrace
  (`--xtrace`). See the [user guide](user-guide.md#waveforms).
* **DPI-C** via `--dpi-lib <path>` — load shared libraries of
  `import "DPI-C"` implementations written in C or C++ (an ISS shim, a custom
  HDL-backdoor layer, your own UVM extensions). The repository ships
  `svdpi.h`, `vpi_user.h` and `sv_vpi_user.h`, so DPI code compiles without
  any vendor installation.
* **VPI** via `--vpi-lib <path>` (`-m`) — the IEEE 1800 VPI routines and value
  formats, simulation and value-change callbacks, and the design object model
  a VPI tool can walk. See the [DPI and VPI guide](dpi-guide.md).
* **cocotb** — Python testbenches run against xezim through a runner backend
  (`contrib/cocotb/xezim_runner.py`) on top of the VPI layer, including timed
  and synchronous callbacks.

## Performance features

* **Edge gating**, on by default — clocked flop fires whose data inputs have
  not changed are skipped (1.13–1.30× wall on the C910/C906 benchmarks;
  `XEZIM_EVENT_EDGE=0` turns it off).
* **Packed memory arena**, on by default — large integral memories are stored
  compactly (`XEZIM_PACKED_MEM=0` turns it off).
* **Warm design cache** — repeated runs skip parsing and elaboration. See the
  [user guide](user-guide.md#warm-design-cache).
* **Native compilation** (`--features jit`) — hot bytecode compiles to machine
  code through the in-process JIT (`XEZIM_JIT=1`) or the AOT backend
  (`XEZIM_JIT=1 XEZIM_AOT=1`). See the
  [user guide](user-guide.md#native-compilation).
* **Profile-guided builds** — see [building](building.md#profile-guided-build).
