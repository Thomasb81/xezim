# What's new in 0.11

### Unreleased

**Correctness**

* An `@(posedge clk iff g)` wait in a class task evaluates its guard in the
  waiting process: the guard reads that object's fields and the task's
  locals (`@(posedge vif.clk iff vif.gnt[master_id] === 1)`), so several
  objects parked on one clock no longer see each other's state. Inside
  `req.randomize() with {...}`, a receiver-qualified element constraint
  (`req.data[0] == d`) and a receiver-qualified size (`req.data.size() == 3`)
  apply to the randomized object; the size used to be ignored. A size that
  conflicts with the class constraints makes `randomize()` return 0. In
  `pre_randomize`, `post_randomize` and when the class has a property named
  like the receiver, `req` keeps its ordinary meaning. (from PR #287 by
  Thomas Burg)
* `randomize()` with a soft constraint and an array sized by the constraints
  no longer fails when a constraint reads a member path through `this`
  (`this.lo`, `this.lim.lo`) that names state rather than a random variable.
  (#256, from PR #257 by Taichi Ishitani)
* A member read through a class handle (`item.item.len`) no longer picks up
  an unrelated struct variable of the same name in another scope or another
  process, and a class handle sent through a mailbox from a parameterized
  class reaches the receiver while another specialization's struct receiver
  is waiting. A `ref` or `const ref` class-handle formal keeps following the
  caller's variable after the caller reassigns it. (#258, #260, from PR #259
  by Taichi Ishitani)
* A base class specialized with named parameter assignments inside an
  `extends` argument (`extends wrap #(.BASE(base #(.REQ(REQ))))`) binds its
  parameters by name; it used to bind them by position, which could end in a
  null dereference.
* A parameter declared with a type or range takes its value as an assignment
  to that type, for its default, a `#(...)` override and a `defparam`: the
  value is evaluated in the declared width, wrapped to it and given the
  declared signedness. `parameter [3:0] P = -1` is 15, `signed [3:0]` turns 15
  into -1, and `#(.P(4'hF + 4'h1))` on `[7:0]` is 16. Real values round
  (`parameter int P = 2.6` is 3), 2-state types drop x and z, and
  unpacked-array elements and pattern overrides wrap per element. A value
  parameter typed by a type parameter keeps that type's full width, and a
  range that uses another parameter of the same instance uses the instance's
  own value. (#237, from xezim-core PR #52 and PR #264 by Ganesh T S)
* A function or task with an early `return` inside a loop that cannot be
  unrolled no longer crashes the bytecode compiler ("index out of bounds")
  or leaves a caller's `break`/`continue` unpatched, which hung the
  simulation; a `for` loop whose header falls back to the interpreter no
  longer does either. (#268, from PR #267 by AaronKel)
* A static call on a class specialization that nests another one or uses
  named parameter assignments (`uvm_config_db#(cfg#(AW,DW))::get`,
  `db#(cfg#(.AW(AW),.DW(DW)))`, `db#(.T(...))`) resolves the enclosing
  class's parameters at every level, so the getter reaches the specialization
  the setter wrote. (#269, from PR #270 by AaronKel)
* `foreach` over an associative array keyed by class handles binds the loop
  variable to the key's class, so property writes through it land; an
  associative array returned through a class method's `output` formal is
  copied back; and processes parked on NBA-region completion (as in
  `uvm_wait_for_nba_region`) resume only after the time slot's queued
  processes, their `#0` continuations and their nonblocking assignments have
  run (IEEE 1800 §4.5). (#277, from PR #275 by Thomas Burg)
* `Alias::type_id::create(...)` through a chain of class typedefs, including
  package-qualified aliases and a parameterized specialization in the middle
  of the chain, reaches the class's factory registry, so factory overrides
  apply and the object is not null. (#274, from PR #276 by AaronKel)
* An unrolled `for` loop over a signed variable runs the right number of
  times when its bounds are negative (`for (int i = 1; i > -1; i--)`); it
  used to run zero times. (#278)
* A class member read or compared through a handle, through `this` or by its
  bare name in a method (`t.irq != x`) is no longer mistaken for an interface
  instance of the same name. (#271, reported by AaronKel)
* A covergroup in a parameterized class builds its bins from that
  specialization's parameters (`bins b[] = {[0:N-1]}`), so
  `get_inst_coverage()` counts samples correctly. (#273, reported by AaronKel)
* `pop_front()`/`pop_back()` on a queue of unpacked structs returns every
  member, whether it goes to a local, a class property, a return value, an
  argument or a declaration initializer, and the initializer form pops only
  once. A scalar `bit` argument of a class method has the formal's one-bit
  width. (#272, reported by AaronKel)
* `randomize()` with a soft constraint and an array sized by the
  constraints no longer returns 0 when the joint solver gives up: once its
  runs are used up, an assignment that satisfies every constraint is
  accepted. (#256, reported by Taichi Ishitani)
* The constraint solver handles more shapes: packed-struct fields set from
  other random variables, bit and part selects of random array elements,
  elements or bits at positions chosen by random variables, equalities whose
  sides wrap at their width, `$countones`, and `foreach` over a state vector.
  (#255, reported by rharikrishna25)
* Assertion control (§20.11, §20.12) is implemented: `$asserton`,
  `$assertoff`, `$assertkill`, `$assertpasson`/`$assertpassoff`,
  `$assertfailon`/`$assertfailoff`, `$assertnonvacuouson`/`$assertvacuousoff`
  and `$assertcontrol` (Lock/Unlock, assertion-type and directive-type masks,
  `levels` and a list of scopes or assertion names). They apply to
  concurrent, immediate and deferred assertions and to covers; they used to
  print "assertion control is not modeled" and be ignored, so assertions kept
  firing after `$assertoff`.
* `size()` on queues and dynamic arrays, `num()`/`size()` on associative
  arrays, `len()` on strings, `num()` on enums and mailboxes, and the array
  query functions (`$size`, `$bits`, `$unpacked_dimensions`, ...) return a
  signed `int`, so `q.size() - 2` on an empty queue is -2 and a loop such as
  `for (i = 0; i < q.size() - 1; i++)` no longer runs about 4 billion times.
  `$size` of an associative array is its number of entries, and `$bits` of a
  queue is its current size in bits. (#280)
* A `wait (...)` inside a DPI-exported task called from C blocks until its
  condition holds even when a timed event (a clock) is pending; it used to
  hang until the run ended. This covers event `.triggered`, nets and the
  task's own automatic variables, other processes' `wait`s keep resuming
  meanwhile, and a wait that can never be satisfied ends the run with the
  task still waiting. (#279, reported by Dragon-Git)
* `randomize()` solves classes with rand variables wider than 64 bits: a wide
  member that no constraint reads no longer blocks the rest of the class, and
  shifts by a constant, masks, part and bit selects, struct fields,
  `==`/`!=`, `inside` and comparisons on wide scalars, wide array elements
  and wide packed structs are solved over 64-bit segments. Arithmetic on a
  wide variable is still left to the trial loop. (#261, reported by Taichi
  Ishitani)
* `randomize()` solves `$countones` constraints whose other side is not
  linear, such as `$countones(strb[i]) == 2**size` in AXI write transactions,
  with counts following the uniform distribution over solutions (§18.5.10).
* `randomize()` no longer reports success with a violated `foreach`
  constraint over a state vector, queue, dynamic array or packed array, or
  one nested in another `foreach` (§18.6.1).
* Copying an unpacked struct with a wide multi-dimensional packed member is
  done 64 bits at a time instead of bit by bit.
* `$bits` and the array query functions (`$size`, `$dimensions`,
  `$unpacked_dimensions`, `$left`, `$right`, `$low`, `$high`, `$increment`)
  of a fixed-size unpacked-array variable fold to its declared shape wherever
  a constant is needed: localparams, parameter values, packed widths and
  generate conditions. `localparam P = $bits(fx)` on `int fx[4]` was 0 and
  is now 128.
* A `generate if`/`case` condition or a generate `for` bound may use these
  queries; `if ($size(fx) - 5 < 0)` used to be rejected as not constant. A
  generate `for` genvar that starts from a parameter, a negative number or an
  expression no longer starts at 0.
* An integral operand of a real operator is converted from its own value and
  width: with `int unsigned u = 1`, `(u - 2) * 1.0` and `r = u - 2` give
  4294967295.0, not 18446744073709551616.0 (§11.8.2).
* A `let` may be declared in a function, task, class method, `begin`/`fork`
  block, generate block, checker, program or clocking block (§11.13).
  Instances follow the standard's substitution rules, including defaults,
  typed formals and the width of the surrounding expression, and
  `import pkg::name` and `pkg::name` reach package lets. (#283, reported by
  Dragon-Git)
* Subroutine prototypes (`extern`, `pure virtual`, interface class, DPI)
  accept a typedef return type with packed dimensions, such as
  `extern function M [1:0] f();`. DPI imports may return a typedef of an
  integer, real or other small C type. (#284, reported by Dragon-Git)
* `--dpi-lib` works on non-x86 hosts: the DPI export trampoline is built with
  `$CC` (default `cc`) and no x86-only flags, and a trampoline build failure
  is named in the library-load error. (#282, reported by Dragon-Git)
* A variable whose type is a typedef of a virtual interface
  (`typedef virtual bus_if vif_t; vif_t v;`) starts as `null` at module,
  `$unit`, subroutine and block scope and in arrays, and `$typename` names
  virtual interfaces as declared (`virtual bus_if.mp`,
  `virtual pbus_if #(16)`) instead of `logic`. (#285, reported by Dragon-Git)
* `$readmemh`, `$readmemb`, `$writememh` and `$writememb` reach another
  instance's memory through a hierarchical name from tasks, functions and
  class methods, and through instance-array elements (`ra[1].mem`). A target
  that names no memory is reported as an error, and a file that cannot be
  opened as a warning, instead of being skipped silently. (#281, reported by
  jjts)
* A class that extends a parameterized class resolves the base's type
  parameters, including defaulted ones such as `RSP = REQ`, in its own
  methods: `RSP::type_id::create()` in a `uvm_driver #(item)` subclass no
  longer returns null (§8.25).
* A class property typed by a type parameter, such as a sequence's `req`, is
  no longer mistaken for a same-named struct variable elsewhere, so each
  `req = ...::type_id::create()` takes effect.
* `$size`, `$left`, `$dimensions` and the other array queries report
  per-dimension bounds for multi-dimensional packed class properties and for
  members of struct formals (§20.7).
* A dynamic-array class property initialized with `new[n]` is sized when the
  object is constructed (§8.7).
* `find*`, `min`, `max` and `unique` locator methods work on associative
  arrays with integral keys, in key order (§7.12).
* With these, the axi4 AVIP's write, read and write-read tests run to
  completion.

**Usability**

* `XEZIM_INIT_REG=random` now varies with the run's seed (`+seed=<n>`,
  `-sv_seed <n>`), so a reset bug that depends on the power-up value can be
  found by changing the seed; the same seed reproduces the same values, and
  no seed (or seed 1) gives the pattern earlier releases used.

* `-fst_scope_file <file>` reads FST dump scopes from a file (one or more per
  line, `#`/`//` comments), and `-xezim_env <file>` sets `XEZIM_*` variables
  from a file (`NAME=value`, `export`, `setenv`, `unsetenv` lines) before xezim
  reads any of them, so a run's settings can live next to its file list
  whatever shell starts it.

* `-uvm` (or `--uvm`) adds the UVM library that `XEZIM_UVM_DIR` names, for
  compile and simulation alike: its `src` directory joins the include path and
  its `uvm_pkg.sv` the file list, so a UVM testbench needs only its own files.
  `XEZIM_UVM_DIR` may name the `src` directory, a release root, or a checkout
  of several releases, where `XEZIM_UVM_VERSION` picks one (default: the
  newest). Without `-uvm` nothing is added.

* `-override_timescale <unit>/<precision>` (also `--override-timescale`)
  gives every design element, package and compilation unit one timescale,
  replacing every `` `timescale `` directive, `timeunit`/`timeprecision`
  declaration and `--module-timescale`: with `1ns/1ns` a bare `#10` is 10 ns
  everywhere, with `1ps/1ps` 10 ps. Literals with a unit (`#3ns`) keep their
  absolute value. It works on the command line and in `-f`/`-F` files.

**Waveforms**

* An FST scope can carry a depth, `LEVEL:SCOPE`, both in `--fst-scope` and in
  a `-fst_scope_file`: `1:top.u_cpu` dumps only that scope's own signals,
  `2:top.u_cpu` one level of children too, and no prefix (or `0:`) every
  level, as `$dumpvars` does (§21.7.1.4).

* Ctrl-C and SIGTERM also stop a long loop inside one time slot, and close
  the waveform dumps normally. When the run cannot stop (a DPI call that does
  not return), the FST dump is closed at the current time before the process
  ends. FST dumps reach the disk at least every 2 seconds
  (`XEZIM_FST_FLUSH_SECS`), so a run killed with `kill -9` or by running out
  of memory leaves a readable file up to its last write.

### 0.11.1 — complete VPI, faster memory models, IEEE 1800 conformance fixes (October 2026)

**Correctness**

* A loop variable declared in `for (int i = ...)` or `foreach (arr[k])` no
  longer binds to a same-named variable in a child instance: the loop runs on
  its own storage. It used to read the child's x and run zero iterations, or
  step the child's counter. A bare name also no longer follows an earlier
  hierarchical reference such as `u.x = 1` down into that child. (#195, from
  PR #196 by Ganesh T S)
* A member access through a struct no longer lands on an unrelated class
  object whose handle number happens to equal the struct's value: the path is
  chosen from the declared type. This covers struct variables, collections of
  structs, hierarchical references, `ref` formals and part-selects, a
  module-level struct holding a class handle, and class handles declared
  through a typedef (including a parameterized one). (#193, from PR #194 by
  Ganesh T S)
* Members of a struct-typed class property resolve at any depth: indexed and
  part-selected members, nested structs, and queue, dynamic and associative
  array members, in methods and at module scope. (#197, from PR #198 by
  Ganesh T S)
* A class that extends a parameterized class without giving all its
  parameters (`class d extends base;`) gets their declared defaults, in
  functions and tasks alike. A type parameter used to read as a 1-bit
  `logic`, so a UVM base test built this way created null objects and drove
  nothing. (PR #199 by eenky)
* `+incdir+` directories in a `-F` args file resolve against the file's own
  directory first, so `+incdir+.` means that directory. (PR #200 by Francesco
  Urbani)
* `--dpi-lib` libraries are loaded into the global symbol scope, as the DPI
  guide says, so one library can call another, in either command-line order.
  A call into a second library used to end the run with `symbol lookup
  error`. (#202)
* A `--dpi-lib` library that cannot be loaded stops the run before it starts
  (exit 1), and calling a DPI import that no loaded library defines is a
  `Fatal`. Both used to continue, with the import returning 0, and exit 0.
  (#201)
* `$display` output from a testbench that prints rarely appears as it is
  printed, not only at exit. (xezim-core #49)
* A task enabled without parentheses through a hierarchical path or a
  package scope (`u.t;`, `a.b.t;`, `pkg::t;`) is called. It used to be
  dropped inside a task, so an `always` calling that task spun at time 0
  and the run hung, and directly in an `always` it was rejected as having no
  timing control. A three-level enable inside a task (`a.b.t();`) also kept
  advancing time after `$finish`.
* An exported task called from C returns only when it has finished:
  `fork ... join`, `join_any`, `wait fork`, `wait(...)` and `@(...)` inside it
  now wait, with the rest of the simulation running meanwhile. `fork ... join`
  used to drop the rest of the task and return, and the others returned at
  once. (#204)
* `wait(ev)` on a named event waits for a new trigger every time. After the
  event's first trigger it used to fall straight through.
* VPI: `vpi_mcd_open`, `vpi_mcd_close`, `vpi_mcd_flush`, `vpi_mcd_name`,
  `vpi_mcd_vprintf`, `vpi_flush`, `vpi_compare_objects` and `vpi_get64` are
  available, and `vpi_mcd_printf` writes to files opened with `vpi_mcd_open`
  or `$fopen` instead of only stdout. The DPI guide lists the VPI calls that
  are still missing. (#205)
* `vpi_get(vpiTimeUnit, ...)` and `vpi_get(vpiTimePrecision, ...)` return a
  module's own timescale for a module handle (the two names are now defined in
  `vpi_user.h`), and `svGetTime`, `svGetTimeUnit` and `svGetTimePrecision`
  give the same answers from DPI code. (#206)
* Gate primitives, `#(rise, fall)` gates, UDP instances with parameter
  delays and `wire #d w = expr;` inside sub-module instances keep their
  delays, resolved per instance in the child's timeunit; a sub-module `buf`
  turns z into x as at top level.
* `always @(m[i])` fires in designs that also declare an array of more than
  100,000 elements; every array allocated after the large one used to lose
  element sensitivity.
* Ports with no data type, and ANSI `input logic` / `inout logic` ports, are
  nets (§23.2.2.3); a hierarchical `assign dut.u.clk = ...` onto a net-typed
  port chain drives it. A continuous assign that only reads an unpacked-array
  element no longer creates a phantom 1-bit net named after the array.
* The one-time notes for ignored system tasks (such as `$dumpfile` without
  `--wave`) are written to stderr as one piece, so `$display` output going to
  the same file can no longer land inside one and hide a UVM message from log
  parsers.
* Continuous assigns to a bit or part of an unpacked-array element
  (`assign r[i][j] = ...`, `.out(r[i][j])`) drive the array inside
  instantiated modules. They used to be dropped silently there, which left
  the c906 interrupt controller's gated clocks dead. Writes to a bit of a
  2-D or deeper array element (`m[i][j][k] = ...`) are no longer dropped
  either, at the top level or in procedural code.
* A net delay (`wire #2 w;`, `#(rise, fall, off)`, `#(P)`) delays every
  driver of the net: separate assigns, ports, gates and UDPs. It acts after
  the drivers' own delays and after resolution, bit by bit on a vector. A
  declaration assignment's delay stays that assignment's own. A port bound to
  a net takes the external net's delay. Each of several drivers on one net
  keeps its own delay, and driven `tri0`/`tri1` nets start at x.
* An undriven output port with no data type (`output o`, `output [3:0] o`,
  non-ANSI `output o;`) floats at z. It used to start at x.
* `@(mem[5])`, `@(mem[i])` and `@(posedge mem[i][0])` on a large memory wake,
  in `always` blocks and in procedural waits alike, and continuous assigns and
  `always_comb` blocks reading an element follow writes to it. The event was
  dropped. An event on a select (`v[3]`, `v[5:4]`, `m[i]`) is an event on the
  selected value: edges are judged on the selected bit, and a changed index
  re-selects the element. `posedge v[P-1]` with a parameter index watches the
  right bit.
* A class parameter default is evaluated in the class's own scope, so
  `int D = W*2` and `type U = T` follow the parameters before them in every
  specialization, including typedefs, extends clauses, parameterized
  subclasses and static calls. Specializations that differ only in defaulted
  parameters share statics. Named class parameter assignment (`C #(.W(5))`)
  binds by name, `$typename` lists every parameter, and a class variable
  declared in an instantiated module keeps its specialization.
* A virtual interface reached through any receiver works: class-handle chains
  (`cfg.vif`, `a.cfg.vif`, `this.cfg.vif`), local and formal handles,
  module-scope chains, inherited, parameterized, static and typedef'd
  properties, and vif arrays and queues. This holds for reads, writes,
  nonblocking writes, `@(...)`, `wait(...)`, clocking blocks, interface task
  and function calls, and binding. They used to read 0 or x, drop writes and
  never wake. `@(vif.cb)` in a class method resumes after the clocking block
  samples. (From PR #207 by eenky)
* A call in receiver position (`get_obj().x`, `q.pop_front().addr`) runs
  once. It used to run up to 12 times, and `q.pop_front().addr` drained the
  queue.
* Unpacked-struct members with two or more unpacked dimensions
  (`bit [7:0] m [2][2]`) survive whole-struct copies (module, block-local,
  nested, array, queue and associative-array elements, class properties),
  struct formals of every direction, function returns, assignment patterns and
  `%p`. Only the first dimension used to be seen, so the member read as x
  or 0. A nonblocking whole-struct assignment `b <= a` updates every member;
  it used to get even scalar members wrong. Struct input ports and struct
  continuous assigns carry array members, patterns and `%p` follow a
  descending dimension's declared order, 2-state array members default to 0,
  `num()` on an associative array of structs counts keys, and
  `$size`/`$bits` work on a member sub-array such as `s.mm[1]`.
* A UVM DPI library built from `include/uvm_dpi_xezim.cc` loads. The UVM
  sources it compiles call the SV export `m__uvm_report_dpi`, and built as
  C++ that call was mangled, so `--dpi-lib` stopped with `undefined symbol`.
  The driver now gives everything C linkage, as the reference `uvm_dpi.cc`
  does, and also builds as C. (#208)
* An input port whose connection computes something (`.p(a & b)`) is a net
  of its own (§23.3.3), so `@(p)` no longer wakes when an operand changes
  while `a & b` stays the same. A child reached through a select
  (`.wl(wl[1])`) whose own port has the same name latches again.
* Inlined task bodies no longer see the caller's local variables, an output
  argument is copied back into the caller's own variable, `disable` of a task
  inside `foreach` ends the task, and integer values written to `real` locals
  and formals convert.
* `/` and `%` size both operands to the wider one (§11.6.1); a narrow dividend
  used to narrow a ternary divisor and read x.
* A two-state variable no longer stores x or z when a value with x or z bits
  is written to it from compiled code.
* A member write through a class property whose type is a type parameter
  (`class p #(type CFG = cfg_c); CFG a; ... a.x = 1;`) reaches the object.
  It used to be dropped without a diagnostic, along with compound,
  nonblocking and nested writes through such a property. (PR #209 by eenky)
* A module path or SDF delay that rounds to zero ticks is no delay: the
  change it carries happens in the same Active region as its cause. A clock
  passed through a zero-delay library cell (`(posedge A => (Y:1'b1)) = (0.01,
  100.0)` at 1ps precision) clocked its flops after that time step's
  nonblocking assignments had committed, so they sampled the new values.
* A class whose base class is a type parameter
  (`class wrap_c #(type BASE = base_c) extends BASE`) gets that base in every
  specialization, including one that passes its parameter on
  (`extends wrap_c #(B)`). It used to get no base at all: `super.new()` did not
  run the base constructor, inherited properties read x, inherited methods and
  `super.` calls returned nothing, and `$cast` upcasts failed. UVM's
  `uvm_port_base` and `uvm_reg_sequence` extend a type parameter, so a `$cast`
  from a TLM port to its interface base failed and register sequences never ran
  their `body`. (#210)
* A static property read or written through an object handle (`h.count`)
  reaches the static of the handle's declared class and specialization, also
  through a null handle. It used to read x unless the static had been used
  through the class name first, and writes through a specialized handle were
  lost.
* `$cast` to a variable declared with a class specialization
  (`pbase #(8, byte) x;`) checks the parameters wherever the variable is
  declared: module scope, class property, local, formal or typedef. Outside
  procedural locals it used to accept an object of any specialization.
* An interface class that extends a type parameter is an error in every mode,
  as IEEE 1800 requires, including as a second base (`extends ic_a, B`).
* Class properties take the width of the object's specialization:
  `bit [W-1:0] pv = '1` in `pbase #(8)` is `8'hff`, not the default width's
  fill, and the same holds for member arrays, queues, statics and class-local
  typedefs. A type parameter bound by an ancestor's `extends comp_base #(byte)`
  gives inherited properties, locals and function returns that type's width
  and signedness. A ranged type argument (`#(bit [5:0])`) in a typedef keeps
  its range.
* Variables declared inside functions, tasks, class methods, `begin`/`fork`
  blocks, loops and `always` blocks keep their full declared type (IEEE 1800
  §6.8). A 2-state local no longer holds x or z, an initializer is converted to
  the declared type (`byte unsigned v = 200` used to read -56, `int unsigned
  v = -1` compared as negative), and struct literals, strings, virtual
  interfaces and tagged unions initialize correctly. Packed multi-dimensional
  array locals keep their dimensions.
* 2-state members of an unpacked struct (`int`, `byte`, ...) start at 0
  wherever the struct lives; they used to read x until first written. Member
  defaults (`int a = 3;`) apply to block-local and class-property structs too.
* Bit-stream casts to and from unpacked arrays, dynamic arrays and queues
  (`barr_t'(32'h01020304)`, `int'(barr)`) unpack and pack the elements in
  declared order (§6.24.3); they used to give zeros.
* A base-class handle to a derived object reads and writes the base's copy
  of a property the derived class redeclares (§8.14). Writing through the
  base handle used to change the derived copy.
* A class fixed array sized by a value parameter (`int items[N]`) has each
  specialization's own size, and a static method called through a handle to a
  specialized class sees that specialization's parameters (§8.25).
* Elements of class `byte`, `shortint` and signed-vector queues and dynamic
  arrays keep their sign (`-1` used to read as `255`).
* Writes through a chain of handles of any depth (`n.next.next = new(3)`,
  `a.b.c.x = 5`) are no longer lost (§8.15).
* A class property no longer resolves to a same-named member of an unrelated
  struct variable elsewhere in the design, which used to leave handles null
  and their members x. `%s` of a string read through two handles prints the
  text without padding.
* `q.min() == q.max()` on a class queue property no longer crashes.
* Same-named variables in different packages, or in a package and a module
  that imports it, are separate variables (§26.3). They used to share storage.
* Queue, dynamic-array and associative-array arguments follow §13.5: an
  `input` is a copy (it used to alias the caller's variable), an `output`
  starts empty and is copied back on return, and a `ref` aliases the actual,
  so concurrently forked tasks see each other's writes.
* `@(posedge x)` and other event controls on a `ref` argument wait for the
  actual to change; they used to return at once.
* A queue slice passed directly as an argument (`f(q[1:$])`) passes exactly
  the slice; it used to pass one element, and a recursive function over
  slices overflowed the stack. `q[a:b]` with `a > b` is empty.
* Clocking blocks (§14): `#1step`, `#0` and `#N` input skews sample the
  Preponed, Observed and time-minus-N values (inputs used to return the value
  after the clock edge), output skews including `#1step` are honored, `inout`
  clockvars can be driven, and an `@(cb)` reached right after the raw clock
  edge sees that edge's samples. `#1step` used to be read as `#1`, which also
  dropped the rest of a `default` clocking item.
* `disable` of a named block or task from a process forked inside it ends the
  whole block, kills the processes forked in it and resumes the block's owner
  after it (§9.6.2). The sibling branches used to keep running.
* `force` and `release` on bit- and part-selects of nets hold against the
  net's drivers and hand back only the released bits (§10.6.2). Forces also
  hold on gate-driven nets.
* A level-sensitive `always` block in an instance runs at time 0 when an
  input port's actual has a declaration-initialized value; its outputs used to
  stay x.

**Performance**

* Combinational logic re-evaluates only when a bit it actually reads
  changes (`assign lo = bus[3:0]` stays idle while `bus[7:4]` moves;
  `XEZIM_BIT_SENS=0` restores whole-signal sensitivity), and the two-state
  executors and the settle loop do less bookkeeping.
* Class method calls cache a per-method call plan and save the formals'
  type metadata only when it is rewritten; instantiation reuses a per-class
  template.
* Startup is much cheaper: the design is preprocessed once per run instead
  of two or three times, elaboration and the bytecode compiler allocate far
  less, and a warm `--cache` run loads the stored design about twice as
  fast. `XEZIM_EXIT_AFTER_COMPILE=1` stops right after compile, for measuring
  startup.
* Together, host instructions fall 7% on a C906 CoreMark run and on the
  AXI4 AVIP and 11% on a C910 memcpy run, with identical output; a UVM
  testbench reaches time 0 with about a third of the previous work.
* Designs built from many small instances, such as a cell-level memory:
  input ports that nothing can observe by name are left out
  (`XEZIM_KEEP_PORTS=1` keeps them; waveform dumps, VPI, DPI and hierarchical
  references keep them automatically), AND/OR gates whose other input holds
  the controlling value skip clock-driven evaluation (`XEZIM_CTL_MASK=0` turns
  it off), and `acc = acc | x[k]` reduction loops compile straight-line. A
  64k-cell DRAM model simulates with 1.0 G instead of 11.7 G host
  instructions; a C906 CoreMark run uses 4% fewer.
* Behavioural memory models: a task call from compiled code no longer copies
  the task, and a statement that still needs the interpreter runs inside its
  compiled block instead of sending the whole block to the interpreter. A
  DDR4-style behavioural model runs 4 to 6 times faster.
* Large flat designs start faster: elaboration skips passes that cannot apply,
  and dependency ordering joins nets with very many writers and readers
  (`XEZIM_TOPO_JOIN=0` turns that off). The 64k-cell DRAM model elaborates and
  compiles in about 3.5 s instead of 8.2 s.

**Memory**

* Large memories live in a packed arena by default (integral elements up to
  64 bits in arrays of more than 100,000 cells; `XEZIM_PACKED_MEM=0` turns it
  off), and arrays of 257 or more elements no longer store a name per
  element (`XEZIM_VIRTUAL_NAME_MIN_CELLS` sets the cut-off). `force`/`release`,
  `$readmemh`/`$writememh`, DPI array arguments and `uvm_hdl_force` work on
  arena memories. A C906 CoreMark run peaks at 0.6 GB instead of 2.6 GB.
  `XEZIM_RSS_TRACE=1` prints resident and peak memory at every phase.
* Instantiated `always` blocks stay in their shared form until they compile
  (`XEZIM_LAZY_ALWAYS=0` turns it off), compiled blocks drop their statement
  trees when nothing needs them, and freed memory is returned after
  compilation. The 64k-cell DRAM model peaks at 0.58 GB instead of 1.6 GB, and
  a 256k-cell one at 2.1 GB instead of 7 GB.

**VPI**

* Every routine of IEEE 1800-2017 clause 38 is implemented: user data per
  call instance, `vpi_get_systf_info` with `vpiUserSystf` handles,
  `vpi_handle_by_multi_index`, `vpi_handle_multi(vpiInterModPath)`,
  `vpi_get_value_array`/`vpi_put_value_array`, `vpi_get_delays`/
  `vpi_put_delays` (nets, module paths, timing checks, intermodule paths) and
  `vpi_get_data`/`vpi_put_data` (always 0: xezim has no `$save`/`$restart`).
  `vpiStrengthVal`, the short/long integer, shortreal and raw value formats
  and `vpiTimeVal` puts work; `vpiObjTypeVal` follows §38.15.
* `vpi_register_cb` accepts every §38.36 reason. Simulation-time callbacks
  run in their region order within each time step; `cbValueChange` reports
  every change, including continuous assignments (cocotb edge triggers on
  such nets no longer hang); force, release, assign, deassign, disable,
  statement, error, timing-violation, signal and unresolved-systf callbacks
  are new; `vpi_get_cb_info` and `vpi_remove_cb` work for all of them.
  `cbReadOnlySynch` fires once at the end of a time step.
* A VPI application can walk the whole design (IEEE 1800-2017 chapter 37):
  instances of every kind, packages, generate scopes, named blocks, tasks and
  functions, processes, continuous assignments, gate/switch/UDP primitives,
  specify paths and timing checks, modports, `bind` instances and ports, each
  with `vpiFile`/`vpiLineNo`; `vpiType` is the declared type through
  typedefs, with ranges and typespecs. Ports iterate in port-list order and
  SystemVerilog unpacked arrays report `vpiRegArray`.

**Assertions**

* A failing assertion with no `else` clause (immediate, deferred or
  concurrent, `assume` included) reports `** Error: Assertion error.` with its
  time and scope, as §16.3 requires. It used to print nothing.
* Property and sequence local variables (§16.10) are supported: declarations
  with initializers, match-item assignments `(seq, v = e)` and `local input`
  formals, with a separate copy per attempt. Subroutine calls in match items
  (§16.11) run at each match.
* A concurrent assertion inside an `always` procedure takes its clock from the
  procedure's event control and starts only when the procedure reaches it, so
  an enclosing `if`, `case` or loop gates it (§16.14.6).
* `default disable iff` (§16.15) applies to the assertions of its scope; an
  explicit `disable iff` still wins.
* An `always_comb` or `always @*` whose only reads are inside an assertion
  re-runs when those values change; it used to run once at time 0.
* `a ##1 b == c` delays the comparison, as the operator precedence requires.
  Each copy of an assertion in a generate loop runs (only the first used to),
  and `%m` in its action names the generate block. A named property without a
  clock uses the default clocking.

**DPI**

* Imported DPI tasks that wait through exported tasks suspend and resume
  independently (§35.5.2, Linux with glibc), so concurrent callers no longer
  return in last-in first-out order. Each active call reserves its own stack,
  256 MiB by default; `XEZIM_DPI_STACK_MB` changes the size.
* The §35.9 disable protocol is implemented: `svIsDisabledState()` reports a
  call whose process was disabled, a disabled exported task returns 1, and
  protocol violations are fatal. The C side of imported and exported tasks
  returns `int`.
* `export "DPI-C"` declared in an instantiated module works. Each instance's
  copy is called according to the current DPI scope (`svSetScope`, or the
  calling context import).
* Packed struct and union arguments pass as `svBitVecVal` or
  `svLogicVecVal` in every direction; they used to arrive and return as 0. Multi-dimensional
  open arrays are supported, and output and inout arguments of exported
  functions and tasks are written back to C.

**Tests**

* A new `lrm` test group checks 409 subclauses of IEEE 1800-2023, chapters 3
  to 38 and Annexes D and E, against values taken from the reference
  simulator (169 tests). The test suite has no ignored tests.

**Removed**

* The experimental multikernel / PDES code: the `--multikernel-scope`,
  `--pdes-c910-stub` and `--pdes-c910-ticks` options, the
  `XEZIM_DISPATCHER=pdes`/`perlp` modes and the `XEZIM_PDES_*` /
  `XEZIM_PERLP_*` variables. The library function `simulate_multi` no longer
  takes a `multikernel_scope` argument. Partition-based parallel dispatch
  (`--load-partition`, `XEZIM_PARTITION_*`) is unchanged.

### 0.11.0 — code coverage, reference-parity fixes, faster UVM (September 2026)

**Correctness**

* UVM: a blocking task called on a function result
  (`pool.get("x").wait_trigger()`) suspends the caller;
  `iface_array[i].handle = new` constructs the object; `$typename` of class
  handles, `this` and class typedefs prints `class [pkg::]name #(params)`;
  `std::randomize(obj.member) with {...}` works; queue and dynamic-array
  locals of class methods are per call; 2-state class properties and
  struct members drop X/Z on assignment (UVM register reads of a status
  field returned X); inline constraints tying rand sub-objects together
  are solved jointly; parked `wait(cond)` statements re-check only when a
  name they read changes; SIGTERM and Ctrl-C end a run stuck in a
  constraint solve within 5 s.
* The `--features jit` build compiles again.
* Functional coverage: covergroups work in instantiated modules,
  interfaces, packages, file scope, multi-top designs and classes declared
  in modules (each module instance gets its own covergroup, named `u0.cg`
  in `xezim_cov.json`). Cross bodies support `binsof`, `intersect`, `!`,
  `&&`, `||`, `with` and cross `ignore_bins`/`illegal_bins`; `bins x[N]`,
  transition sets, lists and repetitions work; `option.at_least` applies to
  automatic and cross bins; `@(clk iff en)` and named-event sampling work;
  `cg_type::get_coverage()`, `(covered, total)`, `start()`/`stop()` and
  `cg.option.<name>` reads are supported; `illegal_bins` hits are errors
  (counted by `--error-exit`); unlabeled coverpoints are named after their
  variable; `cover sequence` counts every match; and assertion entries in
  `xezim_cov.json` carry `file` and `line`. Coverage numbers match the
  reference simulator. See docs/coverage-guide.md.
* UVM examples that hung now finish: a clock generator on an interface
  member (`BUS.clk`) toggles its own signal; a non-root module drives
  members of its own interface array (`assign INT[0].irq = ...`); class
  handles in child instances start as null; `semaphore s = new(N)` as a
  class member gets N keys; `new` through a typedef of a parameterized
  class builds that specialization (UVM transaction event pools);
  a redeclared base-class property keeps its own initializer; fixed-size
  arrays declared in class methods are separate per call; a class
  property takes precedence over a same-named module signal; and
  `randomize() with {}` constraints on members of nested rand objects
  (register-model fields) are solved.
* sv-tests: 98.9% pass (from 97.6%). Strict checks reject malformed UDP
  table rows, duplicate non-ANSI subroutine port declarations, constructor
  body port declarations, end labels on unnamed blocks, `#([7:0] A)` without
  `parameter`, `for (var [7:0] i ...)`, `void'` of a non-call, mixed
  positional and named connections, inout port defaults, generate loops
  without a genvar, self and generate-local `defparam` targets, and more;
  non-ANSI port expressions (`.b(a[2:1])`, `{a, b}`) are supported, and a
  ranged non-ANSI subroutine port redeclared as a `reg` is one port.
* `obj.randomize() with {...}` binds names in the object first and then in
  the calling scope (§18.7): caller locals, inherited members, array and
  queue elements, handle members and `local::` names now work, and a
  caller local no longer hides an object member. A receiver-less
  `randomize() with {...}` in a class method applies its inline block.
* Randomization semantics follow the reference simulator: `dist` weights
  hold in coupled constraint sets (`:=` weighs every declared value, `:/`
  the whole item), `solve a before b` picks `a` uniformly, `randomize(a,
  b)` makes exactly the named members random (even non-`rand` ones), and
  an `inside {[hi:lo]}` range with the bounds reversed is empty.
* Processes waiting on a net driven by a continuous assignment (`assign
  CLK2 = PCLK;`) resume after those waiting on its source, and waiters on
  an interface's clock port after both, as in the reference simulator.
  Testbenches that race on this order (the uart UVM example's modem tests)
  now agree with it.
* `%m` and the "Scope:" line of `$info`/`$warning`/`$error` name the
  declaring scope (`pk.f`, `pk.C.show`, `tb.u.E.show`); generate blocks,
  named `always` blocks and labelled assertions are scopes. Auto-detected
  tops run in source order. A class and an interface may share a name,
  a blocking `randcase` branch suspends its process, and package-scope
  initializers may call `$sformatf`.
* Absolute hierarchical writes (`tb.u.sig = v`) inside tasks, functions
  and class methods take effect; a callee's local declaration no longer
  changes a same-named variable's type in the caller (a signed `int` read
  back through `inout` printed unsigned); arithmetic wider than 128 bits
  keeps every bit; a forked package task runs as its own process;
  `s.h = new` on a struct's class-handle member constructs it; `defparam`
  paths resolve upward; a bare name in a class method must be visible from
  that class (UVM 1.2's removed global `factory` is rejected, as the
  reference simulator does).
* sv-tests: 97.7% pass (from 94.8%). New legality checks reject what the
  LRM forbids and the reference simulator rejects: enum, unpacked-array
  and class-handle assignment compatibility, subroutine argument binding,
  constant expressions in ranges/parameters/part-selects, automatic
  variables in NBAs and procedural assigns, enum base types, packed struct
  members, net output ports, replication counts and casting sizes, gate
  terminal counts, package exports and scoped names, and parameter
  overrides. Parser: min:typ:max delays, `and #6 (q, a, b)`, net
  declaration delays after the data type, nameless UDP instances,
  `this.super.x`, and `begin_keywords "1364-2001-noconfig"`.
* UVM 1800.2 (2020.3) DPI: `uvm_re_comp`/`uvm_re_exec`/`uvm_re_compexec`/
  `uvm_re_deglobbed` follow UVM's C code, and `uvm_hdl_signal_size` and
  the `uvm_polling_*` value-change API are built in. UVM testbenches
  compiled without `UVM_NO_DPI` used to abort at time 0 on unresolved
  regex symbols.
* An `inout` or `output` formal passes a virtual-interface handle back to
  its caller even when the actual was null on entry (`uvm_resource_db::
  read_by_name` returned nothing), and a formal no longer leaks into a
  same-named class property.
* An unconnected 2-state `output` port of an interface or module starts at
  0 instead of x, so a clock driven through one toggles.
* Deferred immediate assertions (`assert #0`, `assert final`) run their
  action blocks at the end of the time slot; a report whose process
  resumes first is dropped, and one still pending at `$finish` prints a
  note instead.
* A path-delayed output also delays its first change at time 0, as the
  reference simulator does.
* `randomize() with { ... }` over struct members is about 13x faster.
* UVM tables print their rows: copying a whole element out of a
  class-property collection of unpacked structs (`row = m_rows[i]`, queue,
  dynamic, fixed or associative) gave zeros, so the topology print and
  `sprint()` tables were blank. Such elements now copy, return, compare and
  print with `%p` correctly, and `this.q[i].m` reads and writes them. `%s`
  of a string member reached through a select no longer pads, `%p` of a
  string-valued call prints the string, and `%0p` prints it unquoted.
* Unpacked-struct locals in `initial` blocks and subroutines: member writes
  through selects, packed-member fields and declaration initializers take
  effect, 2-state members start at 0, and members that are arrays of
  structs survive whole-struct assignment.
* Time-0 activation order follows the reference simulator: depth-first
  source order through the hierarchy, bound instances after their host's
  own items (several binds into one host in reverse order), and `initial`
  blocks that cannot suspend run as one group.
* Assertions: named properties and sequences declared in sub-modules and
  interfaces work in `assert property`, every instance of an assertion
  interface evaluates its own assertions (only the first one did), `bind`
  accepts interface targets by name or path, and an action block reports
  its assertion's own scope.
* A virtual interface can be bound to a nested interface instance by
  hierarchical path (`a.d`, `g[0].a.d`), and tasks can be called through a
  generate-block path.
* UVM's DPI-C functions are built in, so `+define+UVM_NO_DPI` is optional:
  regular expressions and globs for config_db, resource_db, factory
  overrides and `+uvm_set_*` plusargs, the command-line processor, and the
  `uvm_hdl_*` backdoor (read, deposit, force, release by hierarchical
  path). A `--dpi-lib` that defines a symbol still takes precedence.
* A second hierarchical write such as `u_sub.sig = v` went into a class
  object instead of the signal once any class object existed (every UVM
  testbench). 2-state variables in instantiated modules no longer hold x/z,
  and a released net takes its drivers' value immediately.
* Specify path delays count the declaring module's timeunit (they ran 1000x
  short in a 1ns/1ps module). All path forms are modelled (`*>`, polarity,
  edge-sensitive, `if`/`ifnone`, 2/3/6/12-value delay lists), the delay is
  chosen per transition and enabled path, and outputs reject pulses
  narrower than the delay. SDF IOPATH still overrides them.
* Identifiers declared nowhere in the design are an error inside task,
  function, class-method, package, interface and program bodies, as they
  already were elsewhere.
* Untyped parameters take the width and signedness of their initializer
  (`localparam C = {8'h1, 8'h2}` is 16 bits, `{4{B}}` and string literals
  keep all their bits, `parameter unsigned P = 5` is unsigned). A `string`
  parameter prints with `%s` like a string variable.
* Several tops each act as their own root: the internal wrapper name no
  longer appears in `%m`, messages, VPI or VCD/FST/XTrace scopes, a
  `defparam` path may start at a top, and `$bits(<type>)` in a child
  instance uses that instance's parameters.
* From the sv-tests suite (now 94.8%): `` `include `` of a function-like
  macro expands fully; paren-less `aa.size` counts entries; `item.index`
  works in locator `with` clauses; `repeat` rounds a real count; `expect`
  blocks until its attempt finishes; `= @ev rhs` without parentheses waits;
  input port defaults use the instance's own parameters; subroutines in
  labelled generate branches resolve; `$bits` of a class type parameter
  works in class constants. Strict mode rejects a second or mis-sized
  non-ANSI port redeclaration, `specparam`/module declarations inside
  generate blocks, class/string/chandle/event nets, and an unqualified
  interface-class typedef used by an implementing class.
* Casts evaluate their operand at the cast type's width (IEEE 1800-2017
  §6.24.1): `int'(a + b)` over 8-bit operands is 300, not 44. This holds
  in procedural code, continuous assigns, constants, packed dimensions and
  constraints; `signed'`/`unsigned'` keep the operand's own width.
  `pkg::T'(x)` casts are no longer dropped, and interpreted `/` and `%`
  size by both operands (`(a + b) / 3` gave 14 instead of 100).
* Typed parameters use their declared width as the context of their value
  (`localparam int P = A + B`), and module header parameters keep their
  declared signedness (`parameter bit [7:0] P = 200` read -56).
* Reductions and sorts with a `with` clause work on class properties
  (`o.arr.sum() with (item * 2)`, `this.arr`, `objs[i].arr`), and
  associative arrays reduce over their keys (`aa.sum()` returned 0).
* Associative-array elements follow their declared type: a missing key
  reads 0 for `int` and x for `integer`/`logic` (function and task locals
  read a 1-bit x), stores take the element's signedness, and `++`/`--`
  keep the operand's signedness (`seen[k]++` on a new key gave x).
* Specify-block timing checks are modelled: `$setup`, `$hold`,
  `$setuphold`, `$recovery`, `$removal`, `$recrem`, `$skew`, `$timeskew`,
  `$fullskew`, `$period`, `$width` and `$nochange`, with edge qualifiers,
  `&&&` conditions, notifiers (toggled in the NBA region, once per time
  step) and negative `$setuphold`/`$recrem` limits. A violation prints one
  `** Error: ... violation in <instance> at time <t>` line, counts toward
  `--error-exit`, and does not stop the run. `+notimingcheck(s)` and
  `+nospecify` disable the checks (the flag used to be a no-op), and
  `+no_notifier` / `+no_tchk_msg` are honoured. A `specparam` declared
  inside a specify block is now a module-scoped constant instead of being
  dropped.
* SDF TIMINGCHECK entries (with edges, `COND` and `INSTANCE *`)
  back-annotate check limits through `--sdf` and `$sdf_annotate`. SDF
  delays now scale to the simulation tick: designs with ps precision got
  delays 1000x too short.
* A package parameter takes its signedness from its declared type:
  `parameter bit B = 1` is 1, not -1, and a ranged untyped package
  parameter takes the declared range's width. The apb AVIP never built its
  master driver because of this.
* A task of an interface or module instance, called in a `forever` loop
  through a virtual interface or a hierarchical path, keeps running. The
  loop used to stop silently or with a false "null receiver" error.
* Clock generators keep first-in-first-out order with the other events of
  their time slot: a `#delay` scheduled after the generator's previous
  toggle resumes after this one. A reset asserted and released around a
  clock edge now spans that edge as it does in the reference simulator.
* A one-element array of instances (`bus_if b[1]`) has its element `b[0]`.
* `@(cb)` for a clocking block declared in a module or interface instance
  waits for the block's clock inside that instance's tasks and processes
  instead of returning at once.
* `randomize()` solves constraint sets that tie many variables together:
  an array `sum()` (including `with (... item.index ...)`), `unique`,
  orderings between elements or arrays, and `->`/`if` around them. When
  the per-variable solver fails, a bounded joint search takes over.
  Infeasible sets of this kind return 0 promptly and leave the random
  variables, array elements included, unchanged. Sums such as
  `a + b + c == K` compare at the full context width instead of wrapping
  at the operand width. A random size variable tied to `arr.size()` is no
  longer pinned to the previous size, and `item.index` reads the element
  index inside reduction `with` clauses.
* String methods on a subroutine formal or local (`name.len()`,
  `name.getc(i)`, `name.substr(i, j)`) read that variable, not a same-named
  signal of some design instance (an interface's `string name`). UVM's
  resource-name check read the wrong string, so its `UVM/RSRC/NOREGEX`
  warning never fired on testbenches with such interfaces.
* A module or interface task reached through a virtual interface or a
  hierarchical path resolves names in its own scope. Called from a class
  method, an unqualified call in its body used to bind to the calling
  class's method of the same name — which is how `uvm_info` inside a BFM
  task was attributed to the calling component instead of the global
  reporter.
* Covergroup coverage numbers match the LRM: `ignore_bins` and
  `illegal_bins` values are excluded from array and automatic bins; an
  automatic cross has the product of its coverpoints' bins (not of their
  value ranges); a crossed variable without a coverpoint is an implicit
  coverpoint that is sampled and counts in the group; `cg.cp.get_coverage()`
  and `cg.cp.get_inst_coverage()` report that coverpoint or cross (they
  returned the group's number); type coverage averages the instances unless
  `type_option.merge_instances` is set; `$get_coverage` weights each type by
  its `type_option.weight`; a `ref` constructor formal reads its actual at
  every sample; bin bounds may be expressions of constructor formals.
* A concurrent assertion clocked by an event without an edge (`@(clk)`, or
  `@clk` on a checker's event formal) samples on every change of the clock,
  as §9.4.2 defines; it used to sample on the rising edge only.
* A checker's event formal accepts an edge actual (`chk u(v, posedge clk)`),
  which used to be a parse error, and the checker's assertions clock on
  that edge.
* A declaration after a statement in a `begin`-`end` or `fork`-`join` block
  or a subroutine body is rejected (§9.3.1); `--no-strict` still accepts it.
* A replication whose count is a signed constant expression is read as
  signed: `{$bits(T) - 1{1'b1}}` in a type-parameterized class whose type
  parameter is unresolved replicates nothing instead of wrapping to about
  four billion copies, which never finished elaborating. Specializations
  keep their widths (`int` gives 31 ones, `byte` gives 7).
* `mailbox` and `semaphore` objects are constructed by every form of
  `new`: a parenthesis-less `mailbox mb = new;` or `mb = new;`, and a
  declaration inside a block (`automatic mailbox #(int) mb = new(2);`,
  `automatic semaphore s = new(1);`). These left the mailbox null (the run
  stopped at "null mailbox handle") or the semaphore without its keys.
* Reading an unpacked-array element with an out-of-range index yields x at
  the element's width (§7.4.6). Three paths produced a 1-bit x that the
  store then zero-extended to `0000000X`: the fused memory-read flop
  (`q <= mem[i]`), a blocking read in a process (`a = mem[i]`) and the same
  read through a task output. Combinational reads were already right.
* Selecting from a class property inside an `always` block or an `assign`
  reads the property instead of zero. `bk.arr[i]`, `bk.arr[3][0]` and
  `bk.arr[i][3:0]` asked the interpreter for `bk.arr` alone, which is an
  array and does not reduce to one number, and then selected from that
  number; an accumulator fed by `bk.arr[i]` stayed at 0 while `$display` of
  the same expression printed the right element.

**Usability**

* Code coverage: `--code-coverage[=stmt,branch,toggle]` (all three by
  default), `--code-coverage-scope=<path>[,...]` and `XEZIM_CODE_COVERAGE`
  turn on statement, branch (if/else and case arms including the implicit
  ones, `?:`) and toggle (per-bit rise/fall) coverage; `+cover[=sbt]` and
  `-coverage` now enable it too. Results go in `xezim_cov.json` under
  `code_coverage`, per instance and per design unit, with a per-scope
  summary under `--verbose`. It is off by default and costs nothing when
  off. See docs/coverage-guide.md.
* `$fwrite`/`$fdisplay` to regular files are buffered (64 KB per handle)
  and flushed on `$fflush`, `$fclose`, `$finish`, `$system`, `$fopen`,
  `$readmem*`/`$writemem*`, DPI/VPI calls and before any read of the same
  file; a 400k-line trace testbench went from 1.78 s to 1.15 s. A
  `tail -f` on a trace file now lags until the next flush.
* The default simulation time limit is 100 ms instead of 100 µs, so UVM
  tests that run for milliseconds (for example 2–25 ms of simulated time)
  finish instead of stopping early. A design that never calls `$finish`
  still stops at the limit; `--max-time` sets a different one, and
  `-do "run -all"` runs until `$finish`.
* Command lines written for other simulators run as-is: bare or `work.`
  top names, `-F`, `-g`/`-G` parameter overrides, `-sv_seed`,
  `-sv_lib`/`-sv_root`, `-svNNcompat`, and a `-do` subset (`run -all`,
  `run <time>`, `quit`, `exit`, `do <file>`; `log`, `add wave` and
  `coverage save/report` are accepted with a warning; anything else is an
  error). Library options (`-work`, `-L`, `-lib`) are ignored with one
  warning; `-c` and `-l` keep their xezim meanings. `run -all` runs past
  the default time cap, and after `run <time>` the closing line and
  `final` blocks see the stop time.
* Runs are quiet by default. The transcript holds the design's output,
  warnings and errors, and one closing line, `Simulation finished at time N
  ($finish called)`. The version banner, `[PHASE]` timings,
  `[PROF]`/`[FUSE]`/`[EVENT-EDGE]`/`[COV]` counters, `[CACHE]` hits and
  `--compile`'s design summary now need `--verbose` (or `XEZIM_VERBOSE=1`,
  `--profile` or `--sim-debug`). The apb AVIP transcript went from 189 lines
  to 150.
* Parse, preprocessor and elaboration errors print `file:line:col` with the
  source line and a caret. A line that came from an `include`d file names
  that file, with an "In file included from" chain, and text produced by a
  macro names the macro invocation. Runtime locations (hang reports,
  port-width warnings) are no longer shifted by `include`s.
* Preprocessor errors and warnings print once per run instead of once per
  pass. Parser warnings, such as an unsupported UDP table, now carry their
  location, and `` `__LINE__ `` after a multi-line `define` reports the right
  line.

**Performance** (instruction counts, output identical)

* UVM class code, round three: member reads, calls, member-target
  assignments and comparisons take direct paths, and flat names, handle
  keys and element names are built without `format!` or clones. UVM stress
  bench: 10.8 M -> 9.0 M host instructions per item (-17%); the six AVIPs
  run 13-15% fewer instructions (axi4 46.6 G -> 39.8 G).
* RTL: process FSMs resolve `<top>.path` reads (a testbench monitor ran on
  the AST path with name lookups every clock), `check_edges` reuses its
  fired-edge buffers, and FSM wait terms are cached: c906 CoreMark 471.5 G
  -> 459.5 G (-2.5%), c906 memcpy -2.1%.
* UVM class code, round two: formal snapshots by position, plain-type
  fast paths for locals and formals, per-class property-owner indexes,
  forward-declared classes (`typedef class X;`, 110 in UVM) on the plain
  paths, and name-set gates in member and call lookup. UVM stress bench:
  11.5 M -> 10.1 M host instructions per item (-12%); axi4 AVIP -6.2%.
* c906 CoreMark -0.4% (elaboration -2.4 G): loop-feedback analysis only
  walks reads when a write reaches a combinational block, waiter wake
  ranks are tracked only once a nonzero rank fires, and the legality
  checker hashes scopes faster and builds messages lazily.
* UVM class code: name-kind checks answer from per-design name tables and
  per-class memos, bare names read and write on direct paths, class task
  bodies are shared instead of cloned per call, and `foreach` over
  associative arrays uses the element index. UVM stress bench: 20.6 M ->
  11.5 M host instructions per sequence item (-44%); the six AVIPs run
  19-27% fewer instructions; c906 CoreMark unchanged.
* A two-state block that reads an x or z bit no longer re-runs on the
  four-state VM: the same lowered stream runs on an x-plane executor that
  applies the VM's four-state rules (Kleene logic, `&&`/`||`/`!` through
  definite-1/definite-0/unknown, ambiguous equality, all-x arithmetic,
  plane shifts, an x selector merging its arms, `if (x)` taking the else
  arm, an x index reading all-x and writing nothing). On the SoC
  benchmarks three quarters of what the VM still executed were such
  re-runs — tiny muxes whose unselected arm or an unwritten register file
  holds x. `XEZIM_TS_X=0` restores the VM re-run; `x_plane_runs=` counts
  them in the profile report.
* Dynamically indexed reads of memory elements wider than 64 bits — a
  vector register file, a cache-line array — now run on the two-state
  executor, both as operands (`vrf[rs]` in wide logic) and as the fused
  memory-read flop (`rdata <= line[raddr]`). They were the largest labelled
  reason for a clocked or combinational block to stay on the four-state VM
  on both SoC benchmarks (21% of a C910 SoC's interpreted combinational
  evaluations, 31% of a C906's).
* `scripts/build-pgo.sh` run without a training command builds a
  profile-guided binary from a bundled trainer (the `tests/perf` shapes,
  `scripts/pgo-train`, `xezim-bench`): about −0.5% host instructions on the
  SoC benchmarks, −12% on a loop-heavy DRAM model, output identical. It is
  the recommended release build; see README.
* Loop-heavy clocked blocks with `int` counters — memory models that walk
  lanes, byte-lane writes into a packed memory, per-lane write pointers —
  now run on the two-state executor instead of the four-state VM. The
  counter's signed tag, its increment, a slice read at a run-time offset and
  range stores at a run-time offset (blocking and non-blocking, into
  vectors wider than 64 bits) all lower now. A DRAM-model reproducer runs
  in a third of the instructions.
* Clocked blocks whose range-store bounds only become constants after
  folding — a generate arm writing `v[g*8 +: 8]` or `mem[g][7:4]` — now
  compile to constant range stores on the element, which the two-state
  executor runs; the dynamic and array forms they used to take kept the
  whole block on the four-state VM (16 such flops on a c906 SoC, 400 on a
  C910 SoC).
* A block that bails on an x read every time it runs (an unwritten memory
  element it keeps reading) no longer pays the two-state entry and guard on
  every evaluation before running interpreted: after eight bails in a row
  it sleeps, doubling the sleep while the bails continue, and wakes for one
  attempt so a value that clears after reset gets its fast path back. x-read
  bails on a c906 SoC fall by 72%.
* Combinational blocks with registers wider than 128 bits — up to 512 —
  run on the two-state executor by default now (`XEZIM_TS_WIDE512=0`
  restores the old behaviour). Three shapes that kept such blocks on the
  four-state VM lower as well: a bus read and then rewritten in the same
  block (`bus = {bus[..], ..}`), a mux between two wide values, and a
  wide `'x` reset default (`{N{1'bx}}`). c906 memcpy runs 1.2% fewer
  instructions from the wide class alone, a C910 SoC 2.5%.
* `tests/perf/loop_block_counters.rs` guards this path with work-counter
  ceilings (two-state admission, bytecode length, backoff engagement).
* The bytecode such blocks compile to is leaner first: a loop variable's
  reads are forwarded into their consumers instead of being copied into a
  temporary each time, `& K`, `* K`, `- K` and `| K` fold their constant
  operand like `+ K` already did, a constant that only becomes one after
  folding is fused too, and `i = i + 1` is two instructions rather than
  five. The same reproducer executes 34% fewer VM instructions before the
  two-state gain above.
* A clocked block whose inputs did not change may now skip an idle edge even
  when another block writes a different part of the same register or a
  different element of the same array. Generated logic that gives
  `status[0]` its own `always` block beside one for `status[6:1]`, or
  `mem[0]` beside `mem[1]`, used to keep every such block firing every
  cycle; each owns its own bits, so all may rest. Blocks that write
  overlapping bits, and any block beside a writer whose element index is
  computed at run time, still fire on every edge. A C910 SoC runs 6.6% fewer
  instructions, a c906 SoC 1.2%.
* Writes that combine two dynamic steps into a packed vector now compile
  instead of falling back to the interpreter: `q[i][j]`, `mem[a][(i*W) +: W]`,
  `s.arr[i].field` and their blocking forms, with either index dynamic. A
  fallback inside a loop over a register-held variable demotes the whole loop,
  so these statements cost microseconds each; a memory model built from them
  runs 41x faster here, and a c906 run is unchanged.
* Selects whose declared dimension does not start at zero or runs ascending
  compile instead of falling back: `v[hi:lo]`, `v[b +: w]`, `v[b -: w]` and
  bit selects on such a vector, and on an element of a packed array. A lane
  vector selected in a loop runs 11x faster here. An element of an UNPACKED
  array keeps the interpreter path, where its label mapping already agrees
  with the writes.
* `XEZIM_FALLBACK_SITES=1` reports every construct handed to the interpreter
  with its reason, source byte span and scope, so the statements worth
  compiling on a slow design can be found without guessing. It now also
  reports the expensive case, a statement that takes its whole loop to the
  interpreter because a fallback cannot be emitted inside one.
* Merging same-sensitivity clocked blocks no longer costs the idle-edge
  skip. The blocks folded into a merged one keep their original statements,
  and the skip census still counted those writes, so every merged output
  looked like it had two drivers and the merged block was disqualified: on a
  c906 SoC only 618 of 3605 blocks could skip, and 55 million flop fires that
  used to be skipped ran. Merging is now worth 6.9% on that design instead of
  costing 18%.
* Reading an element of a packed memory no longer copies the whole memory.
  `mem[addr]` on a `logic [N-1:0][W-1:0]` loaded every bit of `mem` into a
  register and selected the word from that, so each read cost as much as the
  memory is big: a 16x deeper memory cost 3x per read. The slice is taken
  where it lies now, read cost is flat in the memory's size, and a
  32-port read benchmark runs 42% faster.
* Starting a design with large memories is faster again: deciding which
  clocked blocks may skip idle edges asked a hash map, once per element of
  every memory a block writes, whether anything else wrote it. A c906 SoC
  spent 1.8 seconds and several hundred megabytes on 19 million of those
  questions; one byte per signal answers them now, and whole arrays are
  counted as ranges. The pass went from 2.8 seconds to 30 milliseconds and a
  c906 run drops another 4%.
* Designs with large memory arrays start simulating sooner: the pass that
  decides which clocked blocks may skip idle edges named every element of
  every memory a block writes, one string per element, and then read names it
  discarded. A c906 SoC spent 33 seconds there, a second per one-million-entry
  SRAM; that is now arithmetic on the element range, with the same skip
  decisions. The whole run drops 36% of its instructions.

# What's new in 0.10

### 0.10.6 — assertion engine, instance-scoped collections, faster small testbenches (September 2026)

**Correctness**

* Concurrent assertions evaluate as attempts with real sequence matching
  (issues #176–#183): a multi-cycle antecedent (`a ##1 b |-> c`) triggers on
  its last cycle; a ranged consequent (`##[1:2] b`) fails only when the whole
  window has passed; `not (a ##1 b)` fails only on a match; `$past` inside a
  deferred consequent reads the previous clock cycle and returns the type's
  default before enough history exists; `disable iff` cancels attempts in
  flight; property `and`/`or` parse and evaluate; and `(##2 (b))` means the
  same as `##2 b`.
* Sequence operators that used to be accepted and ignored now evaluate:
  repetition `s[*n]`, `s[*m:n]`, `b[->n]`, `b[=n]`; `throughout`, `within`,
  `intersect`, sequence `and`/`or` (also inside an antecedent);
  `first_match`; `strong(...)`/`weak(...)`, with a strong property still
  pending at the end of simulation reported as a failure; `@(negedge clk)`
  and `@(posedge clk iff en)` clocking events; a clockless `assert property`
  under `default clocking`; and named sequences and properties with formal
  arguments used inside a property body.
* Package-qualified variables inside tasks and functions: a write such as
  `store_pkg::scalar = d;`, `pkg::arr[i] = v;` or `pkg::v[3:0] = x;` in a
  subroutine body was silently dropped, and a read of `pkg::arr[i]` or
  `pkg::v[h:l]` there returned 0; both worked from an initial block.
* `%m` inside a continuous assignment whose expression falls back to the
  interpreter names the assignment's instance, and `$time` there scales to
  that instance's timescale, as always-block fallbacks already did.
* With the native compiler on (`XEZIM_JIT=1`), a `$display` or other
  interpreted statement inside a compiled clocked block now runs under the
  block's own instance: `%m` names the instance, bare names resolve there,
  and `$realtime`/`%t` use its timescale. Previously such statements ran
  under the top scope.
* With the native compiler on, a bit-select, part-select or array element
  read whose index or bound carries x/z now yields x across the full
  width, and an element or part-select write with such an index modifies
  nothing, matching the interpreter and IEEE 1800 7.4.6 / 11.5.1. The
  native code previously zeroed the unknown bits and used the result as
  the index.
* A constant part-select write with a negative label (`x[4:-1] = v`,
  `x[0:-1] <= v`) in a clocked block or compiled process keeps its in-range
  bits (IEEE 1800 §11.5.1); the compiled path folded the bounds unsigned,
  dropped the write, and the non-blocking form stored a bit past the MSB.
* A non-blocking read of an array element through an index that holds x or
  z (`q <= mem[idx]`) queues an all-x element instead of element 0, in the
  two-state and four-state engines alike.
* A constant part-select `[l:r]` whose bound is a variable is now an
  elaboration error, as IEEE 1800 §11.5.1 requires; only `[base +: width]`
  and `[base -: width]` take a variable base. Every engine previously read
  the bound from the variable's current value.
* Bit- and part-selects follow IEEE 1800 §11.5.1 in every engine: an
  index or bound with an x or z bit reads x and discards the write instead of
  using bit 0; a constant select below a vector's declared low bound reads x
  instead of the low bits; an ascending vector (`logic [3:10] a`) places label
  `p` at bit `10 - p` for reads and writes alike, so `a[3] = 1` sets the MSB;
  an out-of-range or unknown element index into a packed 2-D value reads a
  whole-x element. A part-select that is partially out of range keeps the
  §11.5.1 per-bit form (only the out-of-range bits read x);
  `XEZIM_OOB_SELECT=whole` makes such a select read x as a whole and
  discards a write through it, as some simulators do.
* An intra-assignment delay inside an edge-triggered `always` block is
  honoured: `q <= #5 v;` schedules the update five time units out and
  `q = #5 v;` suspends the block, as in an `initial` block. Both forms
  previously assigned at once with no warning (#160).
* A class property that is a fixed array of collections (`int q[2][2][$]`,
  `int d[3][]`, `int a[2][int]`) has storage for every element: `q[i][j]`
  accepts `push_back`, `size`, `new[n]`, `exists` and element reads and
  writes, from inside the class and through a handle. Previously each
  element collection was silently empty while `$size(q)` and `foreach`
  answered off the outer shape.
* An unpacked array parameter whose elements are assignment patterns
  (`localparam cfg_t A [3] = '{'{4,2}, …}`) evaluates each element instead
  of reading 0, for packed-struct, unpacked-struct and packed-vector
  element types declared at compilation-unit scope. A constant function
  containing `signed'(e)` or `unsigned'(e)` is now evaluated at
  elaboration, so a `localparam` or typedef width derived from it in a
  sub-instance is correct (it read 0, giving one-bit typedefs).
* A continuous assignment accepts the rise/fall/turn-off delay form,
  `assign #(rise, fall[, turnoff]) net = expr;`, and applies the delay by
  transition as §10.3.3 specifies; a transition to x takes the smallest.
* Collections declared in a module keep one copy per instance. Sibling
  instances of the same module no longer share a queue, dynamic array or
  associative array, and a packed-struct element of such a collection
  (`q[i].field`) reads and writes correctly inside any sub-instance. A
  UVM-style BFM with ten per-client request queues now grants requests.
* Constrained random: without `solve … before`, the antecedent of an
  implication is drawn in proportion to the solution space it selects, as
  §18.5.10 requires, and the consequent's variables are drawn inside the
  implied ranges. `solve … before` keeps the antecedent uniform.
* VPI: `vpi_iterate(vpiPort, module)` yields port objects with name,
  full name, direction and size for the top module and sub-instances, and
  values read through the connected signal; nets and variables keep their
  `vpiNet`/`vpiReg` types. `vpiPort`, `vpiPortBit`, `vpiDirection` and the
  direction values are in `include/vpi_user.h`.
* Write-path fixes: a bit-select write whose index is x or z modifies
  nothing; a continuous assign with a constant right-hand side drives its
  net in a UVM testbench; a non-blocking assignment to a packed-array
  element through a virtual interface keeps its width; a write to a nested
  packed-struct member (`f.hdr.d = v`) lands; elements of a class
  unpacked-struct array read back what was written.
* `always @(sig)` keeps firing after a write made by a process that a
  clock edge resumed.
* A named event or signal written by a process that a clocking block
  resumed (`##2; -> ev;`) wakes its waiters in the same time step instead
  of one clock toggle later.
* A narrow actual bound to an `int`, `logic signed` or `bit signed`
  class-method or constructor formal is extended correctly (`new(2'b10)`
  read −2).
* `#delay` inside a package class, a compilation-unit class, a `$unit`
  task or function, or a `program` scales by the timescale in effect; a
  `timeunit` declared inside a package is honoured.
* Handle chains of any length (`w.r.c`) read correctly from a task inside a
  sub-instance, including a task-local handle named like a sibling
  instance.
* Locals declared inside an instance's tasks, functions and blocks shadow
  the module's own names.
* `bind` with a parameter value assignment is applied; previously the
  bound harness never existed.
* A `ref` formal named like its actual no longer overflows the stack.
* Class methods reach sibling module instances by hierarchical reference
  (issue #155): `core.seq`, `core.get_seq()` and `u_w.p.peek()` work from a
  method of a class declared inside a module.

**Performance** (instruction counts, output identical)

* A compiled stimulus process (the default for clocked initial-block loops)
  now runs its wait-to-wait segments on the two-state executor: waits are
  opcodes that suspend the executor, the process keeps its own two-state
  register file, and a segment that reads an unknown value re-runs on the
  four-state VM from the values it started with, backing off after repeated
  bails. The 100k-cycle self-checking testbench: 2.20G to 2.08G
  instructions; c906 neutral. `XEZIM_PROC_FSM_TS=0` keeps the VM.
* Two more per-tick trims for small testbenches: the check of whether a
  compiled stimulus process can clobber a combinational entry's outputs is
  cached per entry, and a compiled block's two-state stream is no longer
  reference-counted on every evaluation. The 100k-cycle self-checking
  testbench: 2.29G to 2.20G instructions; c906 neutral.
* A clocked block whose only uncompilable statement is a `$display`-style
  call on a cold branch (a check macro's failing arm) now runs on the
  two-state fast path; the interpreter is called for that one statement
  only when it is reached. Blocks that read a signal they later overwrite
  (`failures++`) are admitted too, with those signals restored on a bail
  so the four-state re-run stays exact, and `'0`/`'1` fill literals lower.
  A 100k-cycle self-checking testbench: 2.50G to 2.28G instructions;
  c906 neutral.
* Small clocked testbenches run about 15% fewer instructions: the per-tick
  scratch vectors of the waiter drain, the clock generators and the
  in-process combinational snapshot are reused instead of reallocated,
  parked waiters that do not fire stay in place, and a compiled stimulus
  process skips snapshotting the outputs it can never write. A 100k-cycle
  self-checking testbench: 2.94G to 2.50G instructions, output identical;
  c906 neutral.
* Experimental, opt-in: `XEZIM_TS_WIDE512=1` lets the two-state path carry
  registers up to 512 bits (the c906 vector-unit buses) instead of 128. It
  is off by default because on c906 it costs 5% more instructions: the
  admitted blocks read x-holding buses and fall back every evaluation.
* A testbench's stimulus loop in an `initial` block — clocked waits,
  blocking or non-blocking assignments, `if`/`case`, counted loops and
  system tasks — now runs as a compiled process by default instead of on
  the AST interpreter. A 100k-cycle self-checking testbench went from
  2.8 s to 0.37 s. `XEZIM_PROC_FSM=0` restores the interpreter for every
  initial block; `XEZIM_PROC_FSM=1` still compiles every body that can be.
* The `--profile` report prints the time that fell outside combinational
  entries and clocked blocks (interpreted processes, waiters) as its own
  line, so a run dominated by an interpreted testbench loop no longer
  reports 90% attributed to the little that was sampled.
* `--profile` no longer slows the run it measures: construct times come
  from a 10 kHz sampler thread instead of two clock reads around every
  evaluation. On a 16k-cell gate-level DRAM the profiled simulation phase
  went from 39% slower than an unprofiled run to about 5%; the report's
  percentages are unchanged and its header now states the sample count.
* Two- and three-part concatenations on the two-state fast path carry their
  operands in the instruction, and the settle loop prefetches the header of
  the next injected entry. C906 memcpy at 300 iterations: 2 % fewer cycles
  across both changes, output identical.
* A testbench loop that writes a memory through an absolute hierarchical
  path (`tb.x_soc.<...>.ram0.mem[i][7:0] = ...`) now compiles to bytecode
  like a local-array store. The XuanTie C910 and C906 memory-image loops
  (2.1 million stores at time 0) run in 0.9 s instead of 2.9 s; C906
  memcpy at 300 iterations: 7.7 % fewer instructions, output identical.
* A successful run exits as soon as its output is complete instead of
  first freeing the whole design; on the C910 that was 1.6 s after the
  last line of output.
* Statements run by the interpreter no longer scan the design's whole
  instance list to tell an interface instance from a signal on every
  execution; C910 memcpy at 200 iterations: 135 s -> 127 s.
* The edge detector no longer re-baselines every edge signal after each
  pass: under the dirty-edge scan only the signals that changed are
  re-baselined (plus the operands of sampled-value functions), which is
  what the scan already did for them. C906 CoreMark: 4.0 % fewer
  instructions, output identical; UVM benchmarks unchanged.
* `casez`/`casex` decoders compiled to a jump table now lay their wildcard
  chains out with forward jumps only, and a `casez`/`casex` compare against
  a constant pattern runs on the two-state fast path. The C906 instruction
  decoders (up to 7,500 instructions each) leave the 4-state interpreter;
  CoreMark 0.3 % fewer instructions, output identical.
* The bytecode compiler folds constant register chains: an unrolled
  `i = 0; bus[i] = v; i = i + 1; …` sequence (the C906 decode blocks carried
  230 chained constant adds each) becomes static bit writes, and constants
  nothing reads are dropped. C906 CoreMark: 5.2 % fewer instructions,
  output identical; UVM benchmarks unchanged. `XEZIM_FOLD_CONST_REGS=0`
  disables it.
* The idle-edge prefilter that decides whether a clocked block runs at a
  clock edge now reads one packed state byte per block instead of four
  flag arrays. C906 CoreMark: 1.3 % fewer instructions, output identical.
* Combinational blocks that write one bit or a constant-bound slice into a
  bus wider than 64 bits (`bus[k] = v;`, `dst[63:0] = src[127:64];`, the
  C906 decode-bus shapes) now run on the two-state fast path instead of the
  4-state interpreter, and clocked blocks that read wide buses skip idle
  edges in the prefilter. C906 CoreMark: 2.6 % fewer instructions on top of
  the array-arming change, output identical; UVM benchmarks unchanged.
* Edge-triggered blocks that read or write an unpacked array through a
  dynamic index (register files, memories: `q <= mem[raddr]`,
  `mem[waddr] <= d`) now take part in the idle-edge skip. Every element of
  the array arms the block on write, so an edge with no input change is
  skipped instead of re-executed. On the C906 CoreMark run 858 of 906
  previously always-executed flop blocks now skip: 8.1 % fewer
  instructions, 11 % fewer cycles. UVM benchmarks unchanged.
* `XEZIM_CYCLE_MODE=cycle` selects the cycle-based engine (default
  `event` is the engine as before). Its first stage evaluates the clock
  tree eagerly at each clock-generator edge instead of through the
  combinational worklist; on the C906 CoreMark run it converts the clocks
  of 64 % of the edge blocks, cuts settle passes by 12 %, and produces
  identical output for 0.4 % fewer instructions. Later stages will add
  cycle stepping after reset with event-driven fallback.
* The statement interpreter's three largest routines keep smaller stack
  frames (the statement dispatcher went from 7.8 KB to 3.8 KB per nested
  call), so a deeply nested testbench statement chain stays in cache: the
  UVM benchmark runs about 1.7 % fewer cycles, output identical.
* Process wake-ups are cheaper: the scheduler no longer hashes with
  SipHash, allocates an empty continuation, or clones the process scope
  string on every wake-up, and the timing wheel covers 4096 ticks before
  spilling to the ordered overflow; the next event time is memoized and
  an empty waiter list is skipped. A timed real-number model runs 26.9 %
  fewer instructions; the UVM and CPU benchmarks are unchanged.
* A delay-driven `always` block with a compound body, the timed
  integration step of a real-number model, runs from compiled bytecode
  instead of the AST interpreter: 3.8x faster per step on a fitted-lag
  model (4.1 µs to 1.07 µs), results unchanged (#159).
* Combinational settle passes track entries triggered mid-pass in a bitset
  instead of a heap, array element accesses in compiled blocks resolve
  inline, and an assignment whose value already has the target width copies
  it directly: 5.6 % fewer instructions on the C906 CoreMark run.
* Reads and writes from class methods no longer build a scoped name string
  for every lookup, and virtual-interface bindings are probed without
  allocating, an assignment no longer probes for a pending interface
  return on every write, and the width of a plain variable target is
  remembered per statement: 3.6 % fewer instructions on the axi4 AVIP.
* Clocked monitor blocks that contain a rare `#delay` run compiled instead
  of interpreted, with the same process semantics: 0.3 % fewer instructions
  on C906 CoreMark.
* Combinational settle passes evaluate each entry once per pass, and
  clocked blocks with a blocking statement no longer copy their body on
  every activation: 5.3 % fewer instructions on the C906 CoreMark run.
* Two-state blocks check for x/z as they load: 3.6 % fewer on C906
  CoreMark.
* Wide values (over 64 bits) are copied, tested and resized a word at a
  time; 128-bit concatenations and single-bit replications are built in
  place: 20 % fewer on C906 CoreMark.
* Faster process re-parks and two-state block execution:
  2 % fewer on C906 CoreMark.
* Arithmetic operands are evaluated once when their width is needed: 9 %
  fewer on the axi4 AVIP.
* Parked `wait(cond)` processes that read only class state stay parked
  until that state changes: 11 % fewer on a UVM bench.
* Fewer per-identifier lookups inside class methods: 4.9 % fewer on the
  axi4 AVIP.
* Clocked blocks that only need arming skip the value compare, two-state
  blocks run from one contiguous code arena with a packed per-entry
  header, and the settle loop takes the two-state path before touching
  the entry table: C906 memcpy (2000 iterations) 375 s to 313 s, output
  identical.
* Two-state blocks may now carry signed narrow registers (`integer` loop
  counters and their compares), dynamic bit selects, non-blocking dynamic
  bit writes (`q[i] <= v`) and range writes into buses wider than 64 bits;
  a block is admitted after a read-before-write analysis of its control
  flow instead of a fixed statement-order rule. Every clocked block is
  offered to the two-state lowering regardless of size, and the eight most
  common adjacent instruction pairs run fused. The four `for`-loop flop
  blocks that dominated the C906 interpreter time (arbiters, fill buffer,
  GPIO) now run two-state: memcpy 313 s to 295 s, CoreMark 18 % fewer
  cycles, output identical; UVM benchmarks unchanged.
* Single-bit gates whose output only clocked blocks read (half of all
  combinational evaluations on the C906) are evaluated in one batch at the
  end of each settle pass instead of through the worklist; a default
  assignment of a wide bus (`bus = {265{1'b0}}`) and a 65..128-bit window
  written into a wider bus now lower to the two-state path; the signal
  mirror that only native (JIT) code reads is no longer maintained on
  every write in ordinary runs. C906 memcpy (2000 iterations) 295 s to
  275 s, output identical; UVM benchmarks unchanged.
* A write to a signal that no clocked block or edge sensitivity observes
  (59 % of all writes on the C906) skips the write observer after one
  lookup, and single-bit gates feeding only clocked blocks commit through
  a direct inline path. C906 memcpy 275 s to 263 s, output identical; UVM
  benchmarks unchanged.

### 0.10.5 — class covergroups, DPI exports and unit scope, faster UVM (September 2026)
* **Typedef'd packed arrays keep their dimensions inside instances**: a
  `u7_t [4:0][1:0] a` declared in an instantiated module (including every
  top of a multi-top design, which runs under the synthetic wrapper) had no
  packed geometry recorded, so `foreach (a[i, j])` walked its 70 bits
  instead of its 10 elements while the same module run as the selected top
  was right. The declared dimensions are now chained with the typedef's for
  instance variables, ports and nets alike.
* **`--profile`** prints the end-of-run profile report (by design unit,
  instance and construct, plus the opcode and entry histograms); the same
  as `XEZIM_PROFILE_REPORT=1`.

* **`foreach` and `std::randomize` over multi-dimensional targets**: a
  `foreach (a[i, j])` over a purely packed array (`u7_t [4:0][1:0]`,
  `bit [6:0][4:0][1:0]`) now iterates every named dimension, declared
  dimensions first and then the typedef's (it used to iterate one and leave
  `j` x). `std::randomize(...) with { foreach (a[i, j]) ... }` now draws a
  packed target wider than 64 bits and every element of a 2-D or N-D unpacked
  array (both were left at 0), checks the constraint body with all loop
  variables bound (it passed vacuously before), and repairs per element:
  relational bounds, `elem == e` pins, and `$countones(mask[i][j]) ==
  count[i][j]` couplings, which draw the mask with exactly that many ones.
  A `rand` class property wider than 64 bits is drawn in full as well.
* **`export "DPI-C"` aliases and package-scope exports reach C**: an export
  with a C linkage name (`export "DPI-C" c_reg_write = task reg_write;`)
  now emits the `c_reg_write` symbol the loaded library calls (it emitted the
  SV name, and the library died with `undefined symbol: c_reg_write` on its
  first call). Exports declared inside a package are registered whether the
  package is wildcard-imported, imported by name, or never imported (they
  name a global symbol either way); an unimported package's subroutine is
  reached under its qualified name.
* **Loop variables shadow a same-named variable of an inlined instance**: a
  `for (integer i = 0; ...)` or `foreach (a[i])` inside a child module that
  also declares `integer i` at module scope now binds `i` to the loop. The
  inliner used to prefix every use of `i` to the child's module variable
  while the loop's own declaration stayed bare, so the loop compared an
  x-valued `u.i` and never ran (a gray-code pointer decoder stayed at x and
  an asynchronous FIFO popped the same word forever). The interpreted form
  had the matching runtime defect: the loop variable was written by name
  through the process scope, which for a `foreach` re-triggered the block
  on its own write.
* **Associative-array probes no longer scan the whole signal table**:
  `exists()` on an absent key, the nested-element probe behind every
  associative-array check, and `first()` / `next()` key enumeration now read
  the per-array element index (one set per array) instead of comparing
  every signal name in the design against a prefix. The associative-array
  check itself exits after one byte scan when the name can only be a plain
  collection, the static-collection key is borrowed instead of allocated on
  every builtin-method call, and a dozen per-call debug and tuning flags
  (`XEZIM_ACTIVE_REGION`, `XEZIM_TRACE_SPIN`, `XEZIM_PSETTLE_STATS`, the
  `*_DBG` switches) are read once. The axi4 AVIP retires 6.7 % fewer
  instructions, output identical. `XEZIM_BM_CENSUS=1` prints every builtin
  method call as `[bm] <receiver> <method>` for aggregation.
* **`obj.randomize()` over multi-dimensional properties**: a packed
  multi-dimensional class property (`rand u7_t [4:0][1:0] d`) now has element
  geometry, so `d[i][j]` reads and writes address the element (they were
  single-bit selects) and `foreach (d[i, j])` iterates every element from a
  method or from the module. Elements of a 2-D array property wider than
  64 bits are drawn (they stayed 0). Every fixed array property is drawn on
  every call and the constraint repair then runs over the fresh draws: arrays
  under a `foreach` used to be skipped by the draw and repaired from their
  previous values, so `e[i] < 100` kept zeros and repeated calls returned the
  same values, and the draw used to clobber element pins (`a[0] == 5`
  returned 0) and `foreach` bodies that read another drawn array
  (`$countones(m[i][j]) == e[i][j]`).
* **A `forever` / `always` process no longer re-clones its loop body on every
  wake-up**: the continuation it parks with is built once per loop and
  shared afterwards (C906 memcpy retires 4.2 % fewer instructions, output
  identical). A subroutine-local `virtual` interface variable now binds in
  the frame that owns it, so two class tasks interleaved on delays keep their
  own bindings instead of reading each other's. `cover property` sites are
  tallied as covers in every clocked path, including `s_eventually` /
  `s_always` watchers and vacuous implications. From Thomas Burg's PR #150:
  the two condition-waiter drains are one parameterised routine, the
  `--max-time` hang report lists processes parked for the NBA region, and the
  `this`-property probe no longer clones the class name per lookup.
* **Packed-struct member selects no longer collide with same-named arrays**:
  inside an instance, `inp.sram_renA[2]` on a struct port compiled as a
  two-bit element select whenever any other module declared a packed
  multi-dimensional array called `sram_renA`, because the compiler's
  element-width and dimension lookups fell back to the bare leaf name. They
  now try the exact name, then the instance-scoped name, and use the bare
  leaf only for single-segment names. Elaboration now also removes the bare
  declarator keys that inlining a submodule registers for its own body
  (element widths, packed dimensions, struct layouts, string signals) once
  that instance is fully inlined, so they can no longer be matched from
  anywhere else in the design.
* **System-function results keep their LRM width in compiled blocks** (§20,
  §21): `$countones`, `$clog2`, `$bits`, `$size`, `$countbits`, and the other
  `int`-valued functions contribute 32 bits to an expression's context, the
  `bit`-valued ones 1, `$time` 64, and `$signed`/`$unsigned`/`$past` their
  argument's width. Inside an `always_ff`, `narrow <= $countones(be) >> 3`
  used to size the shift at the 4-bit target and truncate the count before
  shifting; the procedural path was already right. From the audit that
  followed: `int`-valued results are now SIGNED everywhere (`$countones(x) - 8
  < 0` compares signed, `$fgetc` end-of-file tests below zero), the
  interpreter no longer sizes a system call by evaluating it (`$fgetc(fd) &
  mask` consumed two bytes and `$urandom % n` advanced the generator twice),
  `$test$plusargs`/`$value$plusargs` return `int`, a procedural `$past(v)` is
  no longer one edge late and reports "no history" at the operand's width,
  `$sampled(e)` evaluates outside properties, and `$onehot`/`$onehot0`/
  `$isunknown` fold to one bit in constant expressions.
* **Performance round (measured with interleaved `perf stat`, output
  byte-identical in every case):** whole-net identity buffers (`assign y = x`)
  now collapse onto their source by default (`XEZIM_BUF_COLLAPSE=0` opts
  out) — the pass leaves alone any net that is a `force`/`release`/procedural
  `assign` target, any source a process writes (the copy's delta step stays
  observable), gate-driven nets, 2-state/4-state pairs, SDF designs, and
  designs with DPI/VPI libraries; C906 memcpy runs 10.7 % fewer instructions
  and 14 % less wall time, bit-exact against the reference transcript. On UVM
  workloads the runtime scalar-index helper no longer hands calls and member
  accesses to the elaboration-time constant folder (which cloned the whole
  function table per attempt), process contexts are moved rather than cloned
  across wakeups, and clocking blocks poll their clock by signal id; the axi4
  AVIP base test retires 3.7 % fewer instructions.
* **Default timescale for untimed units is `1ns/1ns`** for any module,
  interface, or package without a `` `timescale `` directive (IEEE 1800
  §3.14.2.2 leaves the default tool-defined; this matches the reference
  simulator). Previously an untimed unit reported `1s/1s` while its delays
  counted the design's global tick; now `#1`, `$time`, and `$realtime` all agree
  on nanoseconds and `--dump-timescales` flags every defaulted unit. Pass
  `--module-timescale` to pick a different default.
* **Covergroups declared inside classes work** (§19.3): the class-body
  covergroup is registered, the implicit variable it declares exists, `cg = new`
  in the constructor instantiates it, `cg.sample()` reads the object's
  properties (also when sampled from outside through `obj.cg`), a derived class
  that redeclares `cg` gets its own coverpoints, constructor formals
  (`covergroup cg (int lo, int hi)`) reach the bins, `with function
  sample(...)` formals are bound per call, `option.auto_bin_max` (coverpoint or
  covergroup level) and `cg::type_option.<field>` are honoured, and
  `$get_coverage()` reports the mean over covergroup types. Covergroup and class handles no longer share one
  integer namespace, which had dispatched class object 1 as covergroup 1.
* **DPI at compilation-unit scope** (§35.5.4): `import "DPI-C"` and
  `export "DPI-C"` written at the top of a file are visible in every module,
  like a `$unit` function; they used to be reported as undeclared. Small
  integral returns (`byte unsigned`, `shortint`) read at their declared width
  and sign in expressions, and a 1-bit `logic` argument carries x/z as svLogic.
* **A real assigned to an integral subroutine local rounds** (§6.12.2), as it
  always did for module variables; the local used to keep the real value, so
  `int div = freq / rate;` compared as 32.55 forever and a baud-clock divider
  written that way never toggled.
* **Concurrent assertions inside instantiated modules and interfaces** are
  registered and fire; inlining used to drop them silently. Sequence
  consequents (`a |-> a ##1 b ##1 c`, `a |=> s`) walk their steps cycle by
  cycle, named sequences with unclocked bodies expand, and `cover property`
  is tallied as cover with misses not counted as failures.

### 0.10.4 — power intent, packed-struct codegen, opt-in waveforms (September 2026)

* **Packed-struct member assignments compile** instead of falling back to the
  AST interpreter. `s.m`, nested `s.p.m` (and every `union`-in-struct form),
  `arr[i].m`, an assignment pattern into an array element (`arr[i] <= '{...}`),
  and a function whose body is `return '{...}` were all interpreted at roughly
  3.8 µs per statement. On a struct-payload pipeline benchmark — 8 lanes × 3
  stages of an 88-bit struct, 20k cycles — this took the run from **16.05s to
  0.83s**, reference-exact throughout. Neutral where the shape is absent
  (Ibex is instruction-identical).
* **Streaming concatenations and 2-D array stores compile.** `{>>{…}}` and
  `{<<N{…}}` lower to constant range selects plus one concat instead of the
  AST interpreter (a byte swap written `{<<8{x}}` was ~32% slower than the
  same swap written by hand; it is now within 7%). A store to a 2-D unpacked
  element (`a[i][j] <= v`) reuses the row-major flat index the read path
  already had — a 4×4 array written element-wise every cycle went from 1.92s
  to 0.16s (**12×**), and a loop containing one no longer drops to the AST
  path wholesale. The 1-D memory case always compiled.
* **Mailbox and semaphore ARRAY elements allocate on `new()`.** `mb[i] = new()`
  stored a live-looking handle with nothing behind it, so every `put` silently
  vanished, `num()` stayed 0 and `try_get` always failed, while the same
  mailbox declared as a scalar worked. Fixed for every lvalue shape: module
  scope, inside a class method, through `this.`, through a class handle, and
  in associative / dynamic / queue / multi-dimensional collections.
* **Waveform dumping is opt-in** via `--wave` (see Features). An active dump
  forces loops that would otherwise compile onto the AST path and builds a
  per-signal trace table, so a run that never dumps no longer pays for it, and
  a design that calls `$dumpvars` no longer starts writing a file
  unannounced. `--fst`/`--xtrace` imply it, so existing command lines are
  unchanged.

* **IEEE 1801 power intent** via `--upf` / `--upf-top`: supply nets with
  state and voltage, power switches, corruption of powered-down elements,
  isolation clamps and retention, driven from the testbench through the
  standard `UPF` package (`supply_on` and friends). Multi-file intent chains
  with `load_upf -scope`, `-update` merges into a named strategy, and
  `-elements {.}` names the scope instance. `examples/upf/` is a runnable
  example; see "Power intent (UPF)".
* **`release` inside a level-sensitive block** (`always @(en)`, `@*`, or a
  process resumed by `@(en)`) now returns the net to its continuous drivers
  immediately. It used to keep the forced value until the driver happened to
  change again, because the re-drive was lost inside the settle pass.
### 0.10.1 – 0.10.3 — native compilation and process conformance (August 2026)

* **AOT native backend** (`XEZIM_JIT=1 XEZIM_AOT=1`, needs a `--features jit` build) — the
  compiler emits Rust for eligible combinational entries, edge blocks, and
  process FSMs, builds it with `rustc`, and loads it through a single exported
  API symbol. On the C910 CoreMark run 18,916 / 21,305 edge blocks and
  108,248 / 215,494 combinational entries compile natively.
* **Persistent native cache** — the generated library is keyed on the source,
  optimization level, and xezim build, then stored under
  `$XEZIM_CACHE_DIR` / `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/xezim/native` / `~/.cache/xezim/native`.
  The first run pays the `rustc` cost; later runs load the cached `.so`
  directly. `XEZIM_NO_NATIVE_CACHE=1` opts out.
* **Compiled process FSMs** (`XEZIM_PROC_FSM=1`) — a blocking `always` body
  compiles into a bytecode state machine with explicit wait instructions, so a
  resume re-enters at the saved program counter with per-process registers
  instead of re-walking the AST continuation chain. Blocking tasks and
  `initial` blocks inline into the same FSM, and the FSMs themselves are
  eligible for the native backend.
* **Blocking task calls inside clocked blocks follow process semantics**
  (§9.2.2) — an `always @(posedge clk)` body that calls a task which consumes
  time is no longer executed on the fast edge path. Previously the callee's
  delay advanced simulation time while that slot's non-blocking updates were
  still queued, so a `q <= d;` scheduled before the call committed a few
  picoseconds late; edges arriving mid-call were also mishandled. Such blocks
  now run as processes: NBAs commit in their own slot, and edges that arrive
  while the body is busy are missed, matching the reference simulator.
* **Delays quantize at the declaring scope's precision** (§3.14.3) — a constant
  fractional delay such as `#0.002` is folded and snapped to the precision grid
  of the scope that declares it, at elaboration time, including delays inside
  interface and class methods.
* **`bind` by instance path** (§23.11) — `bind top.u_dut.u_sub tb u_tb();` and
  the colon form specialize only the named instances; module-name binds are
  applied before path binds, and upward references from the bound module
  resolve against the instance it was bound into.
* **Opt-in combinational region fusion** (`XEZIM_REGIONS=1`) — dependency-
  connected compiled entries fuse into topologically ordered region blocks.
  Measured net-negative on the current benchmark set (recompute cost outweighs
  the dispatch saving), so it ships off by default and stays available for
  experiments.

### 0.10.0 — waveform integrity, cocotb, and class-storage fixes (August 2026)

* **FST dumps are correct at scale** — a break-even compression case wrote the
  time table raw while flagging it compressed, corrupting large dumps in
  GTKWave; the writer now records what it actually wrote, dumps are finalized on
  `Ctrl-C`, the final time slot is flushed, and values render on the writer
  thread instead of the simulation thread. Cross-format agreement is checked by
  decoding VCD, FST, and XTrace, not by comparing file sizes.
* **cocotb backend** — Python testbenches run against xezim via
  `contrib/cocotb/xezim_runner.py`, backed by VPI timed and synchronous
  callbacks and a repaired VPI object model.
* **Scheduling-region fixes** — the postponed region is serviced from the nested
  event loop and on livelock recovery, and a delay closes out the slot it
  resumed in, which removed a `$monitor`-vs-waveform timestamp skew.
* **Class and scope storage** — class member arrays resolve through the runtime
  class, `localparam` arrays inside classes elaborate, each instance gets its
  own static task local under non-blocking assignment, packed-struct formals
  read their members from the call frame, and `%m` no longer leaks the scope of
  a suspended task.

# What's new in 0.9

### 0.9.8 — reference-parity audit campaign (August 2026)

Dozens of differential test batteries were run against a commercial reference
simulator; every divergence found was measured construct-by-construct, fixed,
and pinned with a regression test citing the LRM section:

* **Per-evaluator continuous-assign propagation is now the default** (#35) —
  combinational updates propagate with LRM evaluation ordering instead of a
  single batched settle, resolving process-observation orderings that were
  previously unattainable with either batching mode. Escape hatches:
  `XEZIM_EAGER_PROC_SETTLE=1` (previous default) and `XEZIM_LAZY_PROC_SETTLE=1`.
* **UVM `run_test()` termination** (#109) — the phase scheduler advances time
  through run-phase objections; live regression pins run the real Accellera
  library (1.2, 1800.2-2017, 1800.2-2020) in every CI gate.
* **Package export semantics** (§26.6) — `export P::*`, `export P::sym` and
  `export *::*` are honored: a wildcard import re-exposes a package's own
  imports only when exported, and a wildcard export covers only names the
  exporting package references — unexported/unreferenced names are rejected
  exactly as the reference rejects them.
* **Implicitly-static initializer legality** (§6.21) — a local variable with an
  initializer in a static-lifetime task/function is now a compile error
  (explicit `static`/`automatic` required), matching reference behavior;
  for-header declarations, block locals and class methods stay accepted.
* **`alias` as true net unification** (§10.11) and `trireg` charge storage
  (§6.6.4) — aliased nets share one signal slot rather than lowering to an
  assign cycle.
* **Cycle delays synchronize** (§14.11) — `##0` (and a runtime `##(n)` that
  evaluates to 0) waits for the default clocking event when off-edge and is a
  no-op at the edge; `##n` without a designated `default clocking` is rejected.
* **Formatting parity** (§21.2.1.7, §21.2.1.3) — associative arrays print with
  the reference's `'{k:v, ... }` spacing; explicit-width `%h`/`%b`/`%o`
  zero-pad to the minimal core without truncation.
* **Array-method iterators** (§7.12) — `q.sort(x) with (x)` binds the declared
  iterator (sorts and `with`-reductions no longer act on zeros); event controls
  on packed-struct fields (§9.4.2) arm the base vector with a field-value
  compare instead of waking spuriously.
* **`ref` formals alias the actual** (§13.5.2) — callee writes are visible to
  parallel observers mid-call, observer writes reach the callee, and the
  element identity of `ref arr[i]` is frozen at call time.

* **UVM 1800.2-2020.3.1 runs green** — the reference testbench passes against the
  2020.3.1 library (`UVM_ERROR : 0` / `UVM_FATAL : 0`, in/out monitors agree).
  Closing this required a general preprocessor fix (inline
  `` `ifdef ``/`` `endif `` mid-line, §22.6), class-body `localparam` constants,
  and sequencer-path fixes (`process::self()`, fork/join_none automatic-variable
  sharing).
* **User-defined nettypes** (LRM §6.6.7) — `nettype` declarations with
  user resolution functions, Z-skip, and built-in resolution.
* **Per-module timescales** — `$time`/`$realtime` scale to the calling module's
  unit; `timeunit`/`timeprecision` declarations scale delays; `$timeformat`/`%t`
  and `$printtimescale` honored; sub-ns precision down to `fs`; new
  [`--module-timescale`](docs/user-guide.md#module-timescale-extension) CLI extension for
  legacy RTL with no source-level timescale.
* **String & aggregate conformance fixes** — `s[i]` read/write on string
  variables (§11.4.13), `ref`/`output` queue arguments copy back on return
  (§13.5.2), `%p` renders function-local queues/associative arrays (§21.2.1.7),
  `foreach` over a string iterates its content length, `q = {}` clears string
  queues, and a never-touched module-scope queue reports `size() == 0`.
* **Free functions no longer see the caller's class context** (§13.4) — a bare
  name in a package/module function that collided with a caller class property
  used to silently alias the property; queue-property access from outside the
  class (`obj.q.push_back(x)`, `%p` of `obj.q`) now resolves correctly.
* **Gate-level & structural robustness** — multi-dimensional packed arrays of
  unpacked elements (`arr[i][j]`, §7.4), `foreach` over negative/descending and
  packed dimensions (§12.7.3), non-ANSI ports completed by a `reg`/`logic`
  declaration (§23.2.2.1), and per-iteration uniquification of declarations
  inside **nested** generate-for loops (`for(a) for(b) localparam Idx = f(a,b)`).
* **Behavioral clocks & PLLs** — a clock generator whose delay reads a runtime
  variable (`always #(half) clk = ~clk`) now re-evaluates its period every
  toggle, so a PLL reprogrammed at runtime actually changes frequency; verified
  against a commercial simulator alongside UDP primitives, tristate/pull
  strengths, `specify`/timing-check, and divider chains.
* **Dead-clock watchdog** — `XEZIM_STUCK_CLOCK` flags a process parked on a
  clock/reset that never changes while the design keeps churning edges (an
  undriven-net / dropped-cell hang), turning a silent multi-minute grind into an
  immediate, actionable diagnostic (`warn` by default; `abort` for CI).

| lowRISC Ibex (`simple_system`) | CoreMark ×10 | score 2.477304 CoreMark/MHz, 2,765,321 instret, halt at 41,454,505 ns — byte-identical | 447s |
| XuanTie C906 | cmark ×2 | TEST PASSED, 286,469 cycles/iteration | 516s |
| XuanTie C910 (dual-core) | cmark ×2 | TEST PASSED, CoreMark 6.327752, halt at 34,985,250 | 8,028s, including a cold native compile of the whole design |
| mbits-mirafra AVIP suite (UVM) | apb / spi / i3c / axi4 / axi4Lite / uart base tests | 6 of 6 reproduce the reference's `UVM_ERROR` counts and end times, run unmodified with no `--module-timescale` (the untimed BFMs take the `1ns/1ns` default; uart alone needs `--module-timescale 1ps/1ps`); `ahb` runs in xezim but the reference fails to elaborate it | 33s for axi4Lite (28s with FSM + AOT), about 60s for uart, seconds for the rest |

On these CPU workloads a commercial reference simulator is still roughly
4–5× faster; the campaign narrowed the Ibex CoreMark gap from about 30× to
4.3×. **Where the remaining cost sits depends on the design**, and the two
cores profile as opposites:

* **C906 is scheduling-bound.** Running the reference with its optimizer
  disabled (321s) against optimized (77s) and xezim (489s) puts ~4.2× on its
  optimizer and only ~1.5× on the kernel itself, and a symbol profile spends
  ~34% of the run evaluating the design against ~22% deciding what to
  evaluate. Every net stays externally visible, so each combinational result
  is published and its readers notified — the cost the reference's optimizer
  removes by keeping intermediate nets in registers.
* **Ibex is evaluation-bound.** ~62% of the run is in the bytecode
  interpreter (`exec_insns` alone is 38%) against ~22% scheduling. It has
  1,553 combinational entries to C906's 35,267, so the same work is spread
  over ~23× fewer, ~37× hotter blocks.

That split is why native compilation is opt-in rather than default: it is
worth ~23% on Ibex and a net loss on C906 (see **Native compilation**).

The picture is design-shape dependent, and the benchmark set above — all
CPU cores and class-based UVM — under-represents struct-heavy modern RTL. On a
struct-payload pipeline microbenchmark (8 lanes × 3 stages of an 88-bit packed
struct written member-wise, 20k cycles) xezim runs it in 0.83s against the
reference's 59.5s. That is a microbenchmark, not a workload, but it is the
shape the table above contains none of.

| Testbench | Result |
|---|---|
| GettingVerilatorStartedWithUVM vs **1800.2-2017** (`data0`/`data1`/`random`/`many_random`) | 4/4 — exact Verilator parity (monitors agree, `UVM_ERROR`/`UVM_FATAL` = 0) |
| GettingVerilatorStartedWithUVM vs **1800.2-2020.3.1** | green — in/out monitors agree (77/77 packets), `UVM_ERROR`/`UVM_FATAL` = 0 |
| sv-tests UVM 1800.2-2017 example suite | 32/35 pass (3 out of scope: deprecated UVM-1.0 macros, DPI backdoor) |

# Compliance

Full [sv-tests](https://github.com/chipsalliance/sv-tests) run with the
suite's own `xezim` runner (`make report RUNNERS=Xezim`), xezim 0.8.1. The
generated HTML report and per-test CSV are checked in under `reports/`
(`svtests_index.html`, `svtests_report.csv`, and `sv-tests-compliance.md`).

| Category | Pass / Total | Rate |
|---|---|---|
| **All tests** | **4354 / 4768** | **91.3 %** |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;UVM (1800.2-2017) | 484 / 487 | 99.4 % |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;non-`ivtest` | 2153 / 2237 | 96.2 % |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Icarus `ivtest` suite | 2201 / 2531 | 87.0 % |

An earlier run scored only 52 % because a `-I` library directory
(`ivtest/ivltests/`, ~1000 mutually independent single-file tests) was scanned
too eagerly: xezim honors IEEE §23.3.2 library semantics — an `-I` dir supplies
module definitions to satisfy unresolved instantiations — but it was adopting
*every* definition in the directory, so typedefs/enums from unrelated sibling
files leaked into the primary design and failed a spurious §6.18 base-type
check. `resolve_library_modules` now pulls in only the library modules actually
reachable from the compiled design (transitively), which reclaimed ~1870
`ivtest` cases with no change to the native LRM/UVM results.
