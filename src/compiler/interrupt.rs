//! The handler only stores a flag, which is async-signal-safe. The event loop
//! polls it at every time-slot boundary, and long loops poll it on their
//! back-edges, so an interrupted run leaves through the normal exit and
//! `run()` finalizes the waveform dumps.
//!
//! The first signal also arms a backstop alarm: a run that never polls the
//! flag (a blocked DPI call, a loop the polls do not reach) still ends after
//! `INTERRUPT_GRACE_SECS`, through `handle_interrupt_alarm`. Before that
//! happens, the FST guard thread (`fst_sink`) flushes the dump up to the time
//! published in `SIM_TIME`; it holds the alarm off while it writes
//! (`hold_backstop` / `release_backstop`). A second signal ends the process at
//! once.
