//! Background writer for FST (GTKWave binary) waveform dumps.
//!
//! The `fst-writer` body writer packs each value change into an in-memory
//! value-change block and periodically compresses and writes it out. Both the
//! packing and the block flush ran on the simulation thread, where they showed
//! up as ~17x the cost of the simulation itself on an unscoped c906 dump.
//!
//! `FstSink` moves the `FstBodyWriter` onto a dedicated thread and feeds it
//! whole timesteps over an mpsc channel. The simulation thread is then left
//! with only change DETECTION (which needs the signal table and so cannot
//! move); rendering, packing, compression and I/O all happen off it.
//!
//! Ordering is preserved because every send happens under the `pending`
//! mutex and the channel is FIFO. `finish()` is a synchronous rendezvous: it
//! shuts the channel and joins, so the FST trailer is on disk before the call
//! returns.
//!
//! Durability. A value-change block lives in memory until it is flushed, and
//! a run that dies without `finish()` (kill -9, OOM, the Ctrl-C backstop)
//! keeps only the flushed blocks: the reader accepts a file without trailer
//! and takes the end time from the last block, and each block reaches the file
//! whole or not at all (see "crash-safe output" below). So:
//! - the writer flushes a block when it reaches `FST_FLUSH_AT` bytes, and also
//!   once `XEZIM_FST_FLUSH_SECS` (default 2 s) of wall time have passed since
//!   the last flush with data waiting (the first block as soon as it has
//!   data);
//! - a guard thread wakes every `GUARD_TICK` and hands the simulation thread's
//!   partial batch to the writer, so no timestep waits on the simulation
//!   thread for longer than that (and a stuck simulation thread does not hold
//!   back the timesteps it already finished);
//! - on Ctrl-C / SIGTERM that the simulation thread has not taken within
//!   `TAIL_AFTER` (a long computation inside one slot, a blocked DPI call),
//!   the guard closes the dump at the slot time the simulation thread
//!   published (`interrupt::published_sim_time`) and flushes it, holding the
//!   backstop alarm off until the block is on disk.

// fst-writer writes a value-change block through an 8 KB `BufWriter`: a dummy
// section length first, the body in 8 KB pieces as the buffer fills, then a
// seek back to patch the length. A `kill -9` (or OOM kill, or the second
// Ctrl-C) during those writes leaves a block whose length is still 0, or whose
// body stops short, and readers reject the whole file: fst-reader asserts
// `compressed_length <= section_length` (it takes the time-table trailer from
// 24 bytes before a block of "length 0"), and the reference FST library
// refuses to open it. Under load the window is wide: a block of a few MB takes
// hundreds of 8 KB writes.
//
// fst-writer only opens files by path (`open_fst` wraps a `File` in its own
// `BufWriter`), so xezim cannot hand it a buffering writer. Instead it lets
// fst-writer write into a STAGE, an anonymous in-memory file (memfd), and moves
// each finished block into the dump itself:
//
// - The dump always ends in a terminator, an empty SKIP block (type 255,
//   length 0), at which every reader stops. Its 9 bytes never cross a page
//   boundary of the file.
// - A block goes in with two writes. First everything after its 9-byte head,
//   plus a new terminator, lands BEHIND the current terminator: readers still
//   stop at the old one, so a kill here loses only this block. Then the head
//   overwrites the old terminator in one 9-byte write within one page, which
//   a kill cannot split (the kernel checks for a fatal signal only between
//   pages of a write). Before it the block is invisible, after it complete.
// - The header, hierarchy and geometry go in by writing a temporary file and
//   renaming it over the dump, so the path never holds a partial header.
// - At the end the final header (end time and counts, one write inside the
//   first page) goes in last, then the terminator is truncated away; the
//   finished file is byte for byte what fst-writer would have written, with
//   the time tables repaired.
//
// The time-table repair now runs on each block in memory before it is
// written, so the dump is never rewritten in place.
